{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Supplementing","content":"<h1>SUPPLEMENTING</h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our bodies renew themselves 24/7.  Just trying to keep up with our bodies every day wear and tear is hard enough but, the process can go into overdrive because of injury or an illness.  We know that our body is trying to renew and heal itself by way of symptoms that we get when our body is not okay.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are receiving a message that there is damage and we better pay attention to it.  Our cells try and patch or replace bad cells.  It’s easy to see the outside of the body heal like when we get a cut or a bruise and it heals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We can’t see our insides heal so other than symptoms, we really don’t know if our bodies are okay.  For heart disease, cancer and other degenerative diseases, symptoms may not show themselves until it is too late.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That’s why it’s important to be proactive instead of reactive when at that point; we have little to know control.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To extend our lives, we must get rid of cellular damage and while doing so, we must super charge our healing system.  In three steps we can protect, repair and regenerate our cells.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Again, as long as all three of these are functioning properly we are renewing our cells.  If one of these goes array, then our cells become weakened.  We have already stated that free radicals do the most damage to our cells and that our cells are under constant attack from them but, did you know that they attack our cells so much that the damage they do shortens our lives and kills us rapidly?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our cells can withstand a massive amount of punishment from free radicals on their own as long as we have enough antioxidants to neutralize them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If our antioxidants falls below where they are supposed to be, then the free radicals gain the momentum to do us harm.  A few billion hits hear and a few there and then Bam! You have major cellular damage.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If this happens your cells won’t be able to reproduce which in turn ages you and causes death.  The best way to avoid this is to be in the protection mode by supplementing our diets.  Antioxidants are like worker ants for our bodies.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We need essential nutrients and we need phytochemicals.  Essential nutrients are what we absolutely have to have to wake up and stay alive.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These are: A, C and E (antioxidants), antioxidant minerals such as copper, selenium and zinc.  These minerals scavenge free radicals.  Next is, essential fatty acids and amino acids.  These do double duty by being an antioxidant and strengthening our membranes so we can fight viruses.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They are not made by our bodies so we have to get them from our diets.  Unlike essential nutrients, phytochemicals are not required for survival.  However, the nutrients that we get from plants are essential in order to protect ourselves from a degenerative disease.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have cells like T lymphocytes and macrophages that digest free radicals.  They get rid of viruses, bacteria, allergens, and pollution.  They do this before trouble begins.  Thus, we have the protection mode.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next is the repair defense mode. From fixing minor dings to replacing entire cells, the repair must occur rapidly and efficiently.  The slower the rate of repair the faster we age and die.  The rate of repair must be the same as the rate of damage.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is an exception to repair and it’s our DNA.  When we damage our DNA, it’s a direct damage to our genetic code and, without this being intact, a cell can’t do its job to repair or replicate itself.  When this happens, the message to our body becomes scrambled.  A failure like this translates to aging and death.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regeneration is when a cell dies and our body replaces the cell with an exact replica. Renewal is our bodies healing system.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;ll be sharing more about the renewal process in upcoming posts!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>If you would like to get my PDF on how to get started here is the link below:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=imgedit-preview&amp;_ajax_nonce=c3b68c6a16&amp;postid=98&amp;rand=3394\" width=\"135\" height=\"135\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/the-5-huge-mistakes\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/the-5-huge-mistakes-/</a></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"18ef9523-8371-5e84-a478-493138745742"}}
