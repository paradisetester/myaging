I like to ask questions to perfect strangers, and I like to observe people so that I can figure out issues and then write about their pain points.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have noticed that a lot of us use food as a comfort mechanism.  Some of my friends are in denial, and some say that they don&#8217;t care, but in the end, food seems to be an issue that if we don&#8217;t make peace with, the emotional part of weight gain will only drag us down.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What do I see happening?  Well, besides the health ramifications of being overweight, there is the emotional part too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, at times I tend to be a bit superficial by talking about things like being overweight; however, I think that for women, it&#8217;s painful not to fit into the clothes that they once did and to look in the mirror and not like what they see.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I go out with my daughter of twenty-six, and she is small and petite like I once was, and I love the way she looks.  I also ask myself often why I needed to jump four sizes in twenty years too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My husband says &#8220;it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not twenty and who wants to be?&#8221;  Bless his heart he is very supportive.  But for me, I&#8217;m bothered by not fitting into my clothes and more so of the thought of moving up a size or two each decade.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I see some of my friends do what I call &#8220;the great cover-up.&#8221;  They wear big oversized shirts that cover themselves so that they don&#8217;t have to see the weight but, they know it&#8217;s there because they talk about it and how much they need to lose it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They use phrases like &#8220;when I was younger&#8221;  &#8220;when I was skinny&#8221;  &#8220;when I lose this weight.&#8221;  I can understand their pain.  But, when is the time?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Weight affects our happiness.  If you&#8217;ve gained a lot of weight, you may not want to have sex with your partner.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You may stop doing the social things that you once did when you were younger.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Carrying extra weight is emotionally and spiritually painful, and yet, we get to a place where we don&#8217;t know how to get back to who we once were.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So we live with it because there is always tomorrow or worse, we have come to think that not being overweight is no longer an option and that, it comes with getting older.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shame is something that a lot of us women feel when we are overweight.  I&#8217;m not saying that we need to be ashamed of ourselves about anything and especially for being overweight.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What I am saying is that many of us who hide our fat feel somewhat ashamed of it.  It&#8217;s not your fault, and there is no reason to feel ashamed of anything.  When we are ready, we will make a change, but we have to decide to do it too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> I am writing to those of us who feel unhappy with the way we feel because time went by, life moved on and then one day, we realize that we don&#8217;t feel as confident and happy as we once were.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course we are getting older, and of course, we will put on a little weight because our metabolism is, in fact, slowing down but, we can&#8217;t use it as an excuse.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Losing weight is hard, very hard.  Why is it hard?  Because it&#8217;s about changing our mindset.  Not about spending our lives at the gym or dieting.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>Changing your mindset will set your body free.</em></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why do we let ourselves gain weight as we age?</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let&#8217;s take a look at how being overweight and changing our mindset is related.  I already said that I eat when I am bored or stressed and even out of pure habit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure I could become mindful and stop eating when I&#8217;m bored, stressed or whatever but, that&#8217;s not the same as changing my mindset.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What matters here is changing the real issues and not just the symptoms of why I overeat.</p>\n<p>For example, you may overeat and when you do your brain rewards you and releases pleasure chemicals ingo to the same way as drugs and alcohol do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know when I&#8217;m stressego-tofood is potatoes of any kind!  Man does it feel good.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But the truth is, I suffer from anxiety.  It&#8217;s in my DNA.  I was born anxious. My mom died from it; my brothers have it, and I hate to say that, I have even passed the gene down.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With that, I know why I eat too much and drink too much wine.  The thing is, what I do about it that will ultimately cure my weight issue.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An issue that&#8217;s not the real problem but only the symptom of my anxiety.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is it that causes you to overeat or use comfort food as an escape?  If you can take some time to step back to see what the triggers are that make you want to overeat or eat foods that are not healthy, then you can change your mindset.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, I warn you.  You will have to go deep.  You&#8217;ll have to admit to yourself that there is something undone, lacking or that possibly you are unhappy about a situation or situations in your life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then, you will have to change them, and this is the part that will either keep you overeating or not.  Once you do this, you will never have to talk about weight issues again.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure you&#8217;ll have the few pounds that you&#8217;ll probably always think that you need to lose but the real weight, the weight that carries all of the pain will be gone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It won&#8217;t be easy at first, and you may slip into old habits of saying that it&#8217;s just your metabolism or getting older and that, you have no control.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But honestly, you do, and you can have a healthy body if you rid yourself of negative mindsets that have become vicious circles in your life.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Why do we let ourselves gain weight as we age?</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The weight that we carry is not about the food that we eat but instead the emotions that we tie to food.  I know I am not saying anything new here, but when we get this message then we get it!  I mean really.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I used to stand in front of the pantry in sheer boredom grazing at everything that I could take a bite of and before long, I was eating thousands of calories mindlessly.  It kept my mind busy so that I didn&#8217;t have to do the things that had I needed to get done or so I could escape the things that I could not change in my life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It kept my mind busy so that I didn&#8217;t have to do the things that had I needed to get done or so I could escape the things that I could not change in my life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For me, I finally gave in to my anxiety issue, and I have learned to forgive myself for something that is beyond my control, and I learned to see it as a blessing.  I am a sensitive soul, and I guess that&#8217;s not so bad.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Each time I feel the sensation of anxiety coming upon me, instead of reaching for something to consume to take away the feeling, I just sit still, breathe deep and then let it pass.  I try to only eat when I am hungry and not when I need to fill my emotions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, I try to only eat when I am hungry and not when I need to fill my emotions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wish the same for you 🙂</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/2016/10/02/let-get-fat-age/mepicture-4/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1395\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1395\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mepicture-278x280.jpg\" alt=\"mepicture\" width=\"261\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving yourself!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://myagingandwellness.lpages.co/7-step-detox-guide\">https://myagingandwellness.lpages.co/7-step-detox-guide</a></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/17c8259466a6d3e8a4996379f1cc4249/1a478/43694466_s-400x280-1.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2aee40fc-44b8-5d88-8574-7056a5ce1bd9"}}
