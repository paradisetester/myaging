So in essence one might take a dose of Melatonin before going under any radiation treatment or X-rays.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Besides the benefits of helping us sleep as a supplement for insomnia, some are asking if Melatonin is a medical marvel or a medical myth?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course we need a lot more research for the use of Melatonin however, I would say that I take it every night for sleep and it lives up to my expectations.  If I get a recharged immune system as a side effect well, that&#8217;s even better!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Did you know that Melatonin is a hormone?  Yep! I was surprised to learn that and then worried that I was taking a hormone and we all know what some hormones can do and that is to possibly raise our cancer risk.  However, studies have found that Melatonin is absolutely safe.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have a serious illness such as leukemia, lymphoma, an autoimmune disorder or major depression it will be wise for you to consult your doctor before taking Melatonin.  If you&#8217;re pregnant don&#8217;t take it either.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Melatonin provides anti-aging effects without poisoning any of our body&#8217;s organs.  It actually fosters internal harmony.  There is no toxic risk, no dependency, or adverse effects.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;ll keep you updated on what else I find out about it.  Until then, you should probably consider Melatonin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"9421c7b6-e280-5d63-99a8-91bb76dfebe8"}}
