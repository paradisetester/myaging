If what they think to be correct about Resveratrol, then this may change health care as we know it!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This pill that we will take ( Resveratrol) could delay the inevitable.  It will prevent and forestall many of the diseases that come with age starting at age 50, 60, 70 and beyond.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s not a wonder drug that will turn a 90-year old into a 30-year-old, but it will slow the train down at whatever age you are at.  That in itself would have me running out to get it!</p>\n<p>We can slow down the death train if you will.  This is how it works.  In almost all life forms there is a SIRT1 Gene. It&#8217;s ordinarily inactive within us, but when it&#8217;s active,for it triggers a survival mechanism that extends life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Red wine is loaded with Resveratrol and found in the skin of the grapes.  The Resveratrol protects the skin of the grapes from fungus and bacteria.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another way to turn the longevity gene on is to &#8220;stay hungry&#8221; eating a lot of food turns the gene off and dieting (eating fewer calories) turns it on.  It&#8217;s called calorie restriction.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Looking at monkeys in a controlled study, the monkeys that took in fewer calories than the second group who got to eat what they wanted, looked younger, had fewer health problems and lived longer than the &#8220;chunky monkeys.&#8221;  Pound for pound the lighter monkeys do much better.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A hungry life turns on our genetic survival switch and appears to lead to a longer life. So there is a survival advantage live on a calorie restrictive diet.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have to say that I am going to try this however, as I write this it&#8217;s about lunch time for me and I&#8217;m starving just by thinking that I will restrict my calories but, it&#8217;s worth it to try it as I like to do things that keep me healthy and not fad diets and supplements, etc.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate.  I have created a six-step course called &#8220;The Rejuvenation Program&#8221; </em></span></h2>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em> You can check it out by clicking this link: <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.therejuvenationprogram.com/\">http://www.therejuvenationprogram.com</a></span></em></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8361\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8361\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8361\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png\" alt=\"The Rejuvenation Program\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-768x644.png 768w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-624x523.png 624w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-600x503.png 600w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program.png 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8361\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Rejuvenation Program</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Before you go, I created &#8220;The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.&#8221; In just seven</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><em>https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</em></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/277668247d169a13cab08a970523fd2a/1a478/16498926_s-400x280.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"97db16c7-e7a4-533a-b214-0d0810e9524c"}}
