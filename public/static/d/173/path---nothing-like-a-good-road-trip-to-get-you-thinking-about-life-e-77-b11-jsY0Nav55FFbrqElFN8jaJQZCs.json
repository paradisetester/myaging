 I had no appreciation for literally, the journey along the way.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That changed when on the way back from our weekend, I don&#8217;t know if the others were tired or just quietly morning the fact that we were heading back to our everyday lives but, it was silent the whole way back.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was able to think about my life, see the sun setting, see how beautiful the trees actually were and I got to be alone with my thoughts even in the company of others.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I had many real moments where I felt waves of both sadness and happiness come over me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;m turning 50 in a couple of months and I&#8217;m realizing that I have to make some significant changes in my life that will make my life very uncomfortable for a while but, in the end, the changes are just what I&#8217;ve needed to make me happy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Funny how we fight our thoughts and justify our lives because we go through the day to day motions, filling our spirits with being busy so that maybe, we won&#8217;t have to make the decisions that are staring us in the face or whispering in our ear each day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s easy to go on living in a comfort zone that we&#8217;re used to because being comfortable feels so good and it&#8217;s warm even if, it&#8217;s actually the worst thing for us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a very long time my spirit was dying and it was screaming for help but I just wouldn&#8217;t listen to it.  I pushed the voice down and told myself to shut up and appreciate the life that I had.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although I appreciate my life and I know others would love to have my life, I also know that right now I have choices and I don&#8217;t have to be guilty about wanting to be happy.  The biggest epiphany that I had was realizing that I can&#8217;t make others happy.  I can only make myself.  Something I have not done in about ten years.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;ve always felt responsible for making others happy but I didn&#8217;t realize that until I took my road trip.  The cost was more that the money I had left at the casino and I decided I wasn&#8217;t going to pay for the rest of my life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you don&#8217;t get anything else from this blog post, please know and take that statement to heart.  &#8220;You can&#8217;t make others happy.&#8221; And, you are not responsible for making others happy either.  All you can do is be kind and be yourself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sometimes all you need is a good road trip to get you thinking about life!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!
