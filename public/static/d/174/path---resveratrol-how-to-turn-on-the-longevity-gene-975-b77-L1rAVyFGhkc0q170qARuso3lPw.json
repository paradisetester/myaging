If what they think to be true about Resveratrol, then this may actually change health care as we know it!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This pill that we will take ( Resveratrol) could delay the inevitable.  It will prevent and forestall many of the diseases that come with age starting at age 50, 60, 70 and beyond.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s not a wonder drug that will turn a 90 year old into a 30 year old but it will slow the train down at whatever age you are at.  That in itself would have me running out to get it!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We can slow down the death train if you will.  This is how it works.  In almost all life forms there is a SIRT1 Gene. It&#8217;s normally inactive within us but when it&#8217;s active it triggers a survival mechanism that extends life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Red wine is loaded with Resveratrol and found in the skin of the grapes.  The Resveratrol protects the skin of the grapes from fungus and bacteria.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another way to turn the longevity gene on is to &#8220;stay hungry&#8221; eating a lot of food turns the gene off and dieting (eating fewer calories) turns it on.  It&#8217;s called calorie restriction.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Looking a monkeys in a controlled study, the monkeys that took in less calories than the second group who got to eat what they wanted, looked younger, had fewer health problems and lived longer than the &#8220;chunky monkeys.&#8221;  Pound for pound the lighter monkeys do much better.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A hungry life turns on our genetic survival switch and appears to lead to a longer life. So there is a survival advantage for to live on a calorie restrictive diet.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have to say that I am going to try this however, as I write this it&#8217;s about lunch time for me and I&#8217;m starving just by thinking that I will restrict my calories but, it&#8217;s worth it to try it as I like to do things that keep me healthy and not fad diets and supplements, etc.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me know what you think and you&#8217;ll try it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">See the 60 Minutes Video Below:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"625\" height=\"469\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNanExS_bos?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Do you want to look and feel younger?
