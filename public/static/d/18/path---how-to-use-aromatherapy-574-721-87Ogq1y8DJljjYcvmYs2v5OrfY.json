To do this, boil water and remove from heat and add two to three drops of essential oil like rosemary, lavender, tea tree, eucalyptus, chamomile or, palmorosa.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Put a towel over your head and tent your face over the pot or glass bowl, while capturing the steam along with the oil.  Breathe deeply and be very careful to keep your head high enough as to not burn yourself. Keep your eyes closed and enjoy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some say by doing this, we can avoid the onset of a cold, etc.  If at the very least, we relax and feel comfort by doing this.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Floral waters</em></strong> are made by using about ten drops of essential oil added to a sprayer with the purest water you can find.  Four ounces of water to a mixture of whatever oils that you like.  You can spray it on your skin to refresh and relax or, spray it into the air too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Bathing with essential</strong></em> oils can stimulate your skin, induce relaxation, and provide energy to your body.  The heat of the water helps to penetrate your skin thus, enhances circulation.  Rosemary can actually help stimulate the release of toxins.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use essential oils in foot baths and add them to your lotion for a soothing and invigorating feel.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Massage oil</strong></em> (my favorite), works oils into the skin. I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t need to expand on how oils are used in massage however, massage oils are potent and they should be kept in the range of about 10 to 30 drops per carrier oil.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"608ffb10-524b-5b0e-afe6-20ff9b3c7e35"}}
