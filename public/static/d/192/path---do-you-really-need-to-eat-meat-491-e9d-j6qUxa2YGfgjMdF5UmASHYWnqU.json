If we don&#8217;t clean it out, we increase the workload for the kidneys, liver and colon.  These three organs are responsible for cleansing our bodies.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was a Vegan for almost twenty years, now I eat a bit of fish and some dairy.  So basically, I&#8217;m not defined as even a Vegetarian, even though 95% of my diet is fruits and vegetables. Maybe I have conditioned myself to think this way but, I can&#8217;t go without a ton of vegetables daily.  I absolutely crave them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This blog post isn&#8217;t about converting anyone into being a vegetarian nor is it about all of the reasons that meat is bad for you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s about telling you how you can have an alternative to meat sometimes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So when I was a Vegan, people would always ask me &#8220;how do you get your protein?&#8221; I heard this all the time!  The bottom line is that meat promotes the aging process and you can get all of your protein from other healthier sources such as plant proteins that are better for your body.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Grains, fruits, beans, and vegetables are naturally low in protein.  By eating them in combinations your body gets a balanced supply of amino acids without risking a protein overload, because, more protein is not better for your body.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While animal protein raises cholesterol, vegetable proteins have been shown to lower cholesterol.  Also, there is a higher amount of calcium in plant protein which gets absorbed into your bones to be stored rather than being neutralized by amino acids from meat. So it&#8217;s probably wise to say that as we get older, meat contributes to poor skeletal health and more importantly, may contribute to osteoporosis.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not counting soy, no single plant food supplies a complete protein.  Meaning that, no plant provides all eight amino acids needed for our body.   Even one amino acid deficiency is enough to stop our cells from gathering or assembling all the proteins needed for our bodies to grow and heal.  This is what&#8217;s meant when we hear about cells building proteins by joining amino acids to form chains.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here&#8217;s a quick overview of why you might consider adding plant based foods to your diet:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Grains and beans are complementary plant proteins.</li>\n<li>Contrary to common belief, you don&#8217;t have to have have complementary proteins at the same time or same meal.</li>\n<li>Feed your body a variety of of complementary plant proteins on a regular basis therefore, you will optimize all of the amino acids you&#8217;ll need.</li>\n<li>Plant based foods are a way for your body to renew itself.</li>\n<li>Plants are low in fat, high in minerals, vitamins, phyto-chemicals, and fiber.</li>\n<li>You won&#8217;t get protein overload which hurts your body over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One note to mention here.  Be careful of where you buy your plants as most are corrupted with pesticides and chemicals that can do more harm than good.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can spend money on your health now by prevention, thus buying organic or spend your money on managing your health later when it may be too late.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, organic food costs more and that&#8217;s really unfortunate that we have to pay more money to eat cleaner food.  I say shame on the food industry however, for the time being, it is what it is and unless you wan&#8217;t to grow your own (and good for you if you do), then, buy organic so that your organs don&#8217;t have to be overloaded by cleaning your food.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">DO YOU REALLY NEED TO EAT MEAT?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Check out my free &#8220;2 Cheat Sheet Fast Weight Loss Formula&#8221; It&#8217;s the fastest and easiest way to lose weight in either two or four weeks!
