The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at: <a href=\"http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf\">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a></p>\n<h5>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h5>\n<p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>\n<p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>\n<p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>\n<p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</p>\n<p><strong>•</strong> On our Privacy Policy Page</p>\n<p>Can change your personal information:</p>\n<p><strong>•</strong> By logging in to your account</p>\n<p><strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong></p>\n<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>\n<p><strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong><br />\nIt’s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>\n<h5>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h5>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</p>\n<p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>\n<h5>Fair Information Practices</h5>\n<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
