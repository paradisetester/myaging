If you were always a stunning beauty, then you had fifty or more years of outside aesthetics, but know this is not your power.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your power now has to come from within. If God wills and you take care of yourself, you will hopefully have at least another thirty or forty years to live your truth within. This is when the real living begins.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This will be your new power, which has nothing to do with what’s on the outside. You can’t control that anymore. Maybe this is what we are really afraid of. In middle age, it’s hard to control anything anymore, especially our looks and our bodies.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just try to maintain your health and remain positive, and the rest will take care of itself. How can you find your new you? Start by being kind and gentle with yourself, just like you would for a friend who came to you for advice about the fears of aging. You would never be as harsh to a friend as you are to yourself. Be your own best friend. It makes a difference.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you want to find out what great qualities you have other than your looks, ask your partner, your friends, and your kids about how you may have touched their lives in a positive way.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Listen to all the wonderful stories they will tell you about you. They will tell you things that will touch your heart and make you proud of who you are. Notice when they tell you about you, they never tell you about how good you looked, only about how wonderful you are or how unselfish you may be and, how much you are loved by everyone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s a great freedom to let go of the fear of aging. Once you do this, and you really accept it, a great peace will come over you. You no longer have to spend wasted time on ways to stay and look younger.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You will no longer waste time comparing yourself to the younger generation or spending money on things just to keep up with the outside world. Just think about how much extra money and time you will have when you let go and age with kindness toward yourself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can now travel and do whatever you want. You are still you only better. Remember there is nothing broken about us because we have aged. We don’t have to fix our face or change our bodies for anyone, only unless we want to for us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Should you choose to do anything to yourself, do it because it will make you feel better, and because you and only you want to do it. Don’t let your partner talk you into or out of whatever makes you feel happy about yourself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You will never fool Mother Nature, nor will you outrun aging, but if it makes you feel better than do it! You will never be here again, so make it count for you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One day we won’t worry about the wrinkles we have, and what we do or don’t look like, because the real worry will be about our mortality. The point here is to live and not burden ourselves about aging, because we will all age and, one day, what we look like will be the least of our concerns.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our concerns will then be about how to live each day healthy and free from pain. What used to make us uneasy about aging will hopefully only be an issue that we will have let go of so that we may enjoy the time we have left.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Enjoy the time you have left. Go and do everything you want to do without fear, without judgment and without guilt.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"b9251a1b-b633-58f7-86d0-c69a50a658dd"}}
