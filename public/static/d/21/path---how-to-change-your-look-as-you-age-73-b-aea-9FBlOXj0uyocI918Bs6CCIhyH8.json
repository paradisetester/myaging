A habit my husband says he wishes I would change, because he hates lipstick, especially when he ends up wearing mine. I decided to go to a nude lipstick, and it seems to serve me better (okay, with the color hair I have this month).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you don’t change your appearance at least once a year, then you may be guilty of living in a comfort zone, and this is what I am talking about. Is it serving you well? Many times when we don’t make necessary changes to our appearance for fear of looking older, we can look older by dating ourselves.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’m not talking about coloring your hair purple or pink (or blue for that matter), and wearing bright makeup with a mini skirt and stripper heels, gosh no! In fact, that will only make you look older, and let other people know there is something not natural about you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Look at celebrities our age; the underlying theme is neutral with a little splash of color. This could mean you have blonde hair and neutral makeup, with a cute, colorful outfit or some trendy shoes. Or, you could add a pop of shadow with a neutral outfit, and add some color with your bag and shoes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Updating your look shouldn’t cause you stress, nor should it be expensive. It’s a matter of keeping yourself modern. You update your phone, your computer, software, cars, etc. Don’t make yourself less important than the things and events in your life. You are much more important than anything else.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Surprise your partner; believe me, they will love the change even if they don’t admit it. Don’t be too predictable. Don’t grow your hair long only to clip it on the top of your head every day. What’s the point in that? Go for a style, instead of length. It will show off your best features.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And one last thing, clean out your closet! Believe me, if you haven’t worn a piece of clothing in six months, you probably never will. Let go of the past and welcome a new a vibrant future.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many of us don’t realize that we are making mistakes with the way we wear our hair, makeup, and clothing. We can no longer shop the twenty dollar racks and pick out things that aren’t flattering like we did when we were young.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yeah I know, we could make a sack look good back then, we could make anything work. Now it’s an investment we must make in our appearance that makes the difference. Yes, it’s an investment like your home and your car. Don’t you think you should at least come in third to those things, if not first?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just because we should dress age-appropriate doesn’t mean we should dress in an unflattering way; very much the opposite. We can dress to complement our age and look great and even a bit edgy. The goal is to look as good as you can and be comfortable, but not try to re-create your twenties.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We can never go back, so why stress trying to. Be the best for the age that you are now. It’s very refreshing to see a woman own her age and still look great. It’s a glow that comes from within, chose to shine. Many women are afraid to make changes because they feel they will look silly. This is not true. We look ridiculous when we look the same as we did when we were younger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving yourself!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/c7c442646e02d3ba5db713add72ac0ec/1a478/32444263_s-400x280.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"99e909ff-b1ea-5a16-9bcd-91bd75141094"}}
