I&#8217;m doing a remake on the previous video that I did. I actually deleted it because I didn&#8217;t</p>\n<p>give it a fair chance.</p>\n<p>I reviewed it and I said it didn&#8217;t work, but the truth is, the truth is! that I did not use this as I should have.</p>\n<p>Okay. So, why I didn&#8217;t use it the way I should have? For one, I didn&#8217;t follow directions.</p>\n<p>Actually, I didn&#8217;t get any directions. There were videos that I could have watched, but ¬†I have ADHD, so as soon as I get something in a box, I take out the product, I throw away the directions and I think I can do it without it.</p>\n<p>And I always have a fail üòè</p>\n<p>So, to be fair to the Fascia blaster, I wanted to retry it and re-review it for you. So I deleted my other YouTube video, and here is what I think about this product.</p>\n<p>Okay. So, as I&#8217;ve gotten older, I have more and more cellulite on my legs, by my knees, and a bit on the back of my legs.</p>\n<p>I have it on my arms, and on my stomach. And so one day one of my workers told me that I should wear shirts because I have cellulite all over my arms.</p>\n<p>So, I was like, &#8220;You know what? You&#8217;re fired, all right.&#8221; No, I didn&#8217;t fire, but not that time ü§î</p>\n<p>So anyway, I saw the Fascia Blaster on the newsfeed of Facebook and I thought, well, I&#8217;ll try it. and could I buy everything on the news feed so I can review it and then show you what works so you don&#8217;t have to waste your time and your money reviewing products.</p>\n<p>I buy everything on the news feed so I can review it and then show you what works and what doesn&#8217;t so that you don&#8217;t have to waste your time and your money buying products.</p>\n<p>So, I used the Fascia Blaster for the second time. I used it every day for a month. Now, you have to use it really aggressively and you have to use it every day. So, what I do is I use it when I get in the shower. So, I&#8217;ll shower, I&#8217;ll get my skin nice and warmed up, my muscles warmed up, and then as soon as I get out, I&#8217;ll really use it and I use it really aggressively. I use it on my arms and it&#8217;s got rid of all my cellulite. Honestly, it has. The thing about this thing is that you will get bruises for the first two weeks. I know that people will ask me, &#8220;What happened to me? Was I being hit? What was going on at home? Did I get an accident?&#8221; I mean, I&#8217;ve got so aggressive on my legs and I&#8217;ll put a picture of that here.</p>\n<p>Now, you have to use it really aggressively and you have to use it every day.

What was going on at home? Did I get an accident?&#8221; I mean, I&#8217;ve got so aggressive on my legs and I&#8217;ll put a picture of that here.</p>\n<p>I got so aggressive on my legs that I couldn&#8217;t even wear shorts, or a dress, or anything that showed my legs because I think I started way too aggressive.</p>\n<p>So, what are you going to do is you just, wherever your cellulite is, and wherever you want to elongate your muscles, you&#8217;re going to take the Fascia Blaster and you&#8217;re going to rub it on your skin.</p>\n<p>So, I have this shirt on just for this purpose, and I started using it here on my arms up here, and I got a bruise. And believe me, you just got to keep using it. Just don&#8217;t use it on the bruise.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re going to put it on your skin. It&#8217;s going to bring blood your skin, you&#8217;re just going to bring it here and you&#8217;re just going to rub it, rub it, rub it, rub it in the shower. And it&#8217;s just going to break down that fat tissue, and it&#8217;s going to give you amazing, amazing, nice smooth skin.</p>\n<p>As I said, it takes a couple of weeks and it takes consistency, but once you get rid of the cellulite, even if you miss a day or two, you still don&#8217;t have cellulite.</p>\n<p>It does come back eventually if you don&#8217;t use it consistently, but you can skip a day or two as I have.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re going on a trip, you don&#8217;t have to carry this thing around. I know they have another one they just came out with and it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s small to travel with.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s got a handle so you don&#8217;t have to have this big bulky one, but this works really good when you want to do all your legs, the back of your legs, you&#8217;re behind. And I use it really aggressively on my stomach, and it has gotten rid of all of my cellulite.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><b><i>If you want to feel better, look better and have an insane amount of energy in just 14 days!</i></b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><b><i>Then click the link below to get your FREE &#8220;7 Step-by-Step Guide to and feel amazing!</i></b></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8761\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8761\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8761\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-300x246.png\" alt=\"7 step-by-step guide to look and feel amazing\" width=\"300\" height=\"246\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-300x246.png 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-768x630.png 768w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-1024x840.png 1024w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-624x512.png 624w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-600x492.png 600w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM.png 1060w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8761\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://If you want to feel better, look better and have an insane amount of energy in just 14 days!
