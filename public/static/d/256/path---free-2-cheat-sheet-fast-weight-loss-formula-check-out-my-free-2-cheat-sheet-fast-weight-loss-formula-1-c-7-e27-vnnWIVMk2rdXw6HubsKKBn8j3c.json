{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"This is how I stay skinny and eat a ton!","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is how I stay skinny and eat a ton! I love to eat.  Frankly, I wake up and as soon as I open my eyes, I think about eating.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Today I went to lunch with my business partner and I ate a salad with Yogurt dressing, cabbage, spinach, vegetable soup, salsa, and tea sweetened with Stevia and, that was  my second meal of the day!  I usually eat about five times a day plus snacks.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here&#8217;s what I ate</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, my business partner had chicken fried steak, mash potatoes and water with lemon.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Who do you think ate more calories?  Not me.. My business partner did of course. Sure, I ate more food but not even as many calories as he did.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">See that&#8217;s the thing, you can eat a lot (and I mean a lot) maybe more than you probably eat now and still maintain or lose weight.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whenever I go out to eat with others, they ask me if I have a hollow leg.  Really?  I wish.  I don&#8217;t have a hollow leg and I wasn&#8217;t blessed with a high metabolism either.  My mother tells me &#8221; You were born the big boned one in the family&#8221; (thanks mom). In fact, does anyone really have a high metabolism anyways?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, there are some exceptions to the rule but when it comes right down to it, we either eat too much or we don&#8217;t.  You know,  the old calories in calories out kind of thing or, the magic of it all, we don&#8217;t eat the right food combinations which is limiting.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Working out is good but not as important as what you eat.  If all we needed to do to stay thin was to work out  thirty minutes to an hour per day then we could eat all the food we wanted right? Wrong.  Not even athletes can do this.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The thing is that it&#8217;s the type of food and in what combinations that we eat.  Going back to my business partner, a chicken fried steak paired with mash potatoes, that will put weight on us. Not to mention that, the side effects of that type of food is probably not good for our health.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, this blog post is not about lecturing anyone on the ways to eat for better health (although eating this way will make you more healthy).   Nope, this blog post is about showing you the ways that you can eat a ton of food, never be hungry and most importantly, satisfy your taste buds.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let&#8217;s face it, no one likes to eat boring food or starve themselves.  Honestly, when I don&#8217;t eat a lot, I&#8217;m a bit grouchy and no one likes a grouch.  I could never just not eat because my stomach hurts and I get a little spacey.  There is no way.  I love people and food too much because, food should be enjoyed.  No one ever had fun while out to dinner with someone who pretends not to be hungry.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are all hungry and we all pretty much love food.  Why fight it! Eat!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Get this,</p>\n<h2 class=\"section-header\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">99% OF PEOPLE FAIL TO LOSE WEIGHT AND FEEL GOOD BECAUSE THEY DO THIS!</h2>\n<div class=\"about-content-box prefix-15 suffix-15 grid-70 mobile-grid-100\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<div class=\"grid-100 mobile-grid-100 nopadding about-copy-wrap\">\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Eat too many processed foods.</strong></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Believe that they will miss sugar and other unhealthy foods.</strong></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Think that they will get bored with eating healthy.</strong></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Believe that their food options will be limited.</strong></em></li>\n<li><strong>Don’t think that they can eat what they want a lot of times.</strong></li>\n<li><em><strong>They don’t know how to eat healthier and in the right combinations to not feel deprived.</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>BIGGEST MISTAKE OF ALL?   </em></strong><strong><em>YoYo Dieting!</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>(Weight cycling: the repeated loss and regain of body weight.  A weight cycle can range from small weight losses and gains (5-10</em> lbs. per cycle) to large changes in weight (50 lbs. or more per cycle).</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, I will get to the point of this blog post and that is to tell you that I created a little cheat sheet that allows me to eat way more food than most people.
