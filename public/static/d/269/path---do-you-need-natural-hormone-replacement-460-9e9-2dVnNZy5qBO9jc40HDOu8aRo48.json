Hormones make all the big decisions in our bodies, and they are effective in small numbers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Correcting hormone deficiencies can play a huge role in our health and our longevity. The key is to detect and correct hormones successfully.  Hormones can reverse many of the mental and physical changes that we see as normal aging.</p>\n<p>For example, hormone replacement therapy can help with the immune system, brittle bones, muscles loss, memory, insomnia, fatigue, loss of libido, and a lot more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hormones help the body become healthier and heal faster so that we can live a better life and live a longer life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When they say &#8220;hormone replacement&#8221; they don&#8217;t mean that all of a sudden you no longer have any hormones circulating through your blood.  What is meant is that our bodies are making fewer hormones as we age.  In our thirties, the decline begins to take place.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Did you know that the gradual deterioration in hormone reduction is already programmed in our genes? As hormones slow down, aging speeds up.  The rate of reduction usually equals the rate of aging.</p>\n<p>Here are the hormones I&#8217;m talking about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Melatonin</li>\n<li>Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone</li>\n<li>DHEA</li>\n<li>Pregnenolone</li>\n<li>Thyroid</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we restore these hormones, hopefully at the level of when we were younger, we can slow down or dare I say it &#8220;<strong>reverse the aging process</strong>?&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Each type of hormone is specific.  Currently, I am on a small dose of estrogen, a testosterone cream, melatonin, and thyroid hormone.  Do I feel great?  I&#8217;d like to think so. I&#8217;m pushing fifty in a couple of months so, yes, I would want to reverse or at the very least, keep disease away.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the next post, I will break down the above five hormones and how they work.  I will also tell you how you can get tested and what synthetic hormones there are.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Until then, I will ask you.  Have you ever had your hormones tested?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Check out my free &#8220;2 Cheat Sheet Fast Weight Loss Formula&#8221; It&#8217;s the fastest and easiest way to lose weight in either two or four weeks!
