That&#8217;s just not me.  The only thing that had changed was me thinking I didn&#8217;t need my thyroid therapy.  When I got back on it, my mood was back to my happy self again.  Placebo?  I don&#8217;t think so.  I need thyroid medicine whether I like it or not.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course you will need a blood test to determine what your hormone levels are.  It&#8217;s almost certain that, if you are in middle-age and beyond, you will need to balance your hormones.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s true that medical experts disagree about the significance of a Testosterone decline, and whether the health benefits of HRT outweigh the risks.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">HRT (hormone replacement therapy) is something you will have to carefully consider for yourself and whether it&#8217;s right for you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you decide to do HRT, please be careful to work with your doctor and not with some unknown source on the internet.  It only takes the smallest amount of hormones to be effective, conversely, the same is true for damage to be done too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lastly, if you do HRT, try and do natural hormones.  I do bio-identical which are made by a Compound Pharmacist.  It&#8217;s important to know that, just because it&#8217;s a natural hormone doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s without risk.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here&#8217;s a little side note that my doctor told me.  When I was worried about taking hormones because of a breast cancer risk or any cancer risk whatsoever, she said &#8220;Theresa, you have more of a risk for cancer by not balancing your hormones.&#8221;  I&#8217;m putting my faith in my doctor and in my research.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It makes sense because the longer we live the more exposure we have to the things that cause cancer right? So, if we keep our hormones balanced (they make the biggest decisions for our body) then wouldn&#8217;t it be true that without them, we have less of a fighting chance.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"f4d4a03c-3eae-50d5-94fa-ab6ea956da41"}}
