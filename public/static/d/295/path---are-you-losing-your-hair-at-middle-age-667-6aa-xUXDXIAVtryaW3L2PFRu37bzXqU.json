I&#8217;m thinking that I will probably end up more like my mom.</p>\n<p>I also color my hair and use the straightener a little too often which makes my hair break.</p>\n<p>My diet is really good as I only eat fish and vegetables but, I probably drink way too much wine.</p>\n<p>I know if I changed most of these things, my hair would be in much better shape but the trade off is, I kind of like my life and I can deal with my hair loss because of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Hope for Thinning Hair</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Research continues to dispel the notion that some types of hair loss are permanent. Experts at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, for example, recently found that people who struggle with hair loss don‚Äôt have dead follicle stem cells, as previously feared ‚Äî just malfunctioning follicle stem cells, which may be fixable. And another study found that mice with deep skin wounds could regrow hair, sparking hope for a cure for baldness in humans.&#8221; (http://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/woman-dealing-with-hair-loss.aspx)</p>\n<p>I think there will be a stem cell or other therapy coming very soon to stop hair loss. ¬†It may not stop the breakage from the damage that we do to our hair but it may stop the loss at the follicle.
