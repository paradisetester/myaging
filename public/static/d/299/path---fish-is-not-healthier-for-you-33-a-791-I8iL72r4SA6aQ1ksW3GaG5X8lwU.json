But, is fish really healthy?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fish has vitamins A, B12, D, choline, niacin, omega-3 fatty acids and additional minerals like, zinc, iron selenium and magnesium.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So why wouldn&#8217;t we eat fish instead of red meat?  With all of it&#8217;s vitamins and minerals and, lean protein, fish looks like a good alternative to red meat right?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The truth is that fish may be posing health threats and, the risk of eating it may outweigh the benefit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because fish travel in the water they ingest the toxins in the water. With that, fish are commonly contaminated in a soup of waste like, PCBs, pesticides, insecticides, industrial waste, lead, and mercury.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I could continue this list however, I&#8217;m actually feeling a little sick to my stomach while writing this post because, I was a Vegan and Vegetarian for twenty plus years and, a few years ago I switched to fish.  Right now, I&#8217;m not liking what I&#8217;m finding out.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I didn&#8217;t wan&#8217;t do any research on eating fish because I didn&#8217;t want to know the truth.  If I did, like I&#8217;m writing about today, I would have stopped eating fish.  I thought, so long as I ate wild and not farm raised fish, I was good.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fish, animals, and humans, accumulate toxins in their fatty tissue.  The larger the fish, the most vulnerable we are because they eat smaller fish and the concentrations could be thousands of times greater.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is what Dr. Timothy J. Smith said about eating fish:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard of Russian roulette? I call this ocean roulette.  And you play ever time you put fish on your plate.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A quick reference on how fish become contaminated:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fish live in coastal waters, usually near large cities, these cities dump high amounts of toxins and billions of chemicals and these chemicals get passed along to us humans.  I can go into all of the ways that these chemicals are effecting our health but, you get the point by now.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to farm raised fish, the reason that they are not healthier is because the water they swim in is also contaminated by pesticides and herbicides from runoff.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Back to the wild fish.  Wild fish may be safer to eat because they live in cold water which is further away from cities (coastal waters).  However, it doesn&#8217;t guarantee how safe they are to eat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To make matters worse, preservatives are another problem with fish.  Fisherman add them to fish while in travel so they won&#8217;t spoil or rot.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s unfortunate that we humans have to ruin food like fish because what fish does provide is a powerful Omega-3 benefit.  The omega-3 fatty acids have the ability to protect against heart disease, prevent blood clots, reduce triglycerides, reduce inflammation, help with arthritis, and, even help with mental health functioning.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Okay, here&#8217;s the kicker and the last of my bad news about eating fish because, well, what else is there left to say?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another quote from Dr. Timothy J. Smith:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8221; The trouble is, when you eat fish, you&#8217;re ingesting a lot more than omega-3 fatty acids- not just all those toxins.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;But also gobs of saturated fat and cholesterol.  In fact, fish, has just as much saturated fat as beef and chicken, and it raises cholesterol levels just like other animal-derived foods. Not exactly what you&#8217;d call heart-healthy.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Need I say more..Fish Is Not Healthier For You.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Check out my free &#8220;2 Cheat Sheet Fast Weight Loss Formula&#8221; It&#8217;s the fastest and easiest way to lose weight in either two or four weeks!
