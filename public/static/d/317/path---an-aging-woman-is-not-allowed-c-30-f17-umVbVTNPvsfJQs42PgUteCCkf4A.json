Â I wanted to see what the hell they were talking about, so I went to get the full story.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These guys on the show TMZ were laughing at a still shot of Carrie Fisher dancing at the opening party for the 2015 Star Wars movie. Â They made fun of how old her knees looked and how bad her body was aging. Â They all made comments as one after another took a shot at her.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then they showed the video of her dancing, and she looked happy.Â She was in the zone dancing by herself while celebrating this movie that she had been in when she was a beautiful young woman.</p>\n<p>Carrie Fisher has passed away recently ðŸ˜”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I kind of felt sad for her because, well, I&#8217;m a middle-aged woman and I am beginning to feel self-conscious about my looks as I age. Â I would certainly be completely hurt if I knew that men were laughing at the way that I have aged too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shame on people that don&#8217;t allow us to age. Â We are made to feel like it&#8217;s some kind of disease. Â Screw aging gracefully in our culture that is obsessed by youth and trying to be younger (me included) because that&#8217;s just not reality. Â It&#8217;s not allowed here.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The thing is, men can age and lookÂ distinguished while women are not valued after a certain age. Â It&#8217;s bad enough that they say &#8220;men always go younger&#8221; because they have an unfair advantage of dating women that are ten, fifteen, even twenty years younger but, women after fifty are invisible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;m not here to rant about getting older or hate on younger women. Â But, Â I am here to ask why don&#8217;t women get a freakin break when it comes to aging? Â Yeah, we get it, we are not accepted, we don&#8217;t age as well as men, blah, blah, blah, but really, could everyone just keep all the aging comments to themselves?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Women have a lot of pressure already in our society and, add aging to it and, well, we can only control so much. Â The last thing we need is some idiots laughing at our knees.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like I said, &#8220;An aging woman is not allowed.&#8221; Â Wait I know, instead of &#8220;Anti-Aging&#8221; let&#8217;s &#8220;Positively Age!&#8221;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate.
