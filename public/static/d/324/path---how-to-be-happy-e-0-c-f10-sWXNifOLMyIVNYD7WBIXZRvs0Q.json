Some may call this depression, but for me, it wasn&#8217;t.  And, it wasn&#8217;t that there was always something greater and better that I was chasing either.  I know about watering my grass.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wasn&#8217;t looking to escape myself and I certainly never wanted to be anyone but me.  Sure, I could be prettier, smarter and have nicer stuff but really, does any of that make someone happy for very long?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pretty fades, smarter becomes irrelevant, and you can&#8217;t take stuff with you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, I always had this little hole that I couldn&#8217;t fill.  I got some therapy; I had my share of boyfriends to fill it and, I&#8217;ve spent my way through pretty good sums of money only to end up right back to where I had always been.  Back to me the person with the hole.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So when I turned fifty this year, life clicked for me.  I finally got it.  I was happy all along but, I was creating my unhappiness from the disappointment that I created about, all of the ways that I thought life should be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The truth is, life is half chance and half results.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Blame it on the media, magazines, reality shows, friends or whatever but, how to be happy comes back to whether we are comfortable in our skin, at any stage in life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some are luckier than others and get this sooner than I did at fifty but, never the less, I got it before it was too late.  Better late than never for sure.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was it.  I was never comfortable in my skin.  I figured at age fifty; if I weren&#8217;t comfortable by now, I&#8217;d better know how to get that way or find an exit plan because I certainly wasn&#8217;t going to allow myself to grow old and bitter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, I didn&#8217;t want to walk around thinking a part of me was missing for the next half of my life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It doesn&#8217;t matter what age you are, how to be happy is about being comfortable in your skin.  It&#8217;s not about comparing yourself to anything other than the person that you were yesterday.  Not tomorrow either because, you don&#8217;t have that day yet and, you may never get it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another thing that has changed me is the acceptance that life is beautiful and, it&#8217;s quick and, those that we love are here one day and gone the next.  Like both my mother and my brother.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me say that when you forget that your mom has passed away but, you pick up the phone to call her, and then you realize that she is no longer there, not today, not tomorrow, not ever again, life becomes pretty sobering.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are fortunate to have not lost a parent, please, call them every day because, when you do,  you&#8217;ll feel a kind of pain the hurts beyond what you thought was even possible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we realize and contemplate that we too only have a short amount of time, we don&#8217;t have much time other than to be happy.  It is our duty to ourselves to give ourselves this gift.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is what most people will remember you for.  Not stuff, not your looks, not how much money you had.  Happiness is your true legacy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know that bad things happen in life and, these things will pass.  We will all die and so will the people we love.  We will have financial difficulties, and life will sometimes punch us so hard that it knocks the wind out and sometimes, for longer than we had planned.  But, life goes on with or without us, and that&#8217;s just how it is.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is the acceptance part that we must do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;m not here to give you a cheesy line about how grateful you should be or that what you have, others would probably wish for.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> I will say that you and I should take some time every day to remember how short life is and, understand that we don&#8217;t have a lot of time other than to live our lives to the fullest while we are here for the short period that we are.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no magic to being happy.  The secret is to accept the beautiful life that God has given, don&#8217;t over think, add a little gratitude and, keep smiling knowing that you have this day which may be your last.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate.  I have created a six-step course called &#8220;The Rejuvenation Program&#8221;</span></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"> You can check it out by clicking this link: <a href=\"http://www.therejuvenationprogram.com\">http://www.therejuvenationprogram.com</a></span></h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_8361\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8361\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8361\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png\" alt=\"The Rejuvenation Program\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-768x644.png 768w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-624x523.png 624w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-600x503.png 600w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program.png 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8361\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Rejuvenation Program</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"7884cf4e-ff7c-509b-9fde-dedb0bf68617"}}
