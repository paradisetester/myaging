Â What do you eat? Â Do you eat meat?</p>\n<p>If you want to stop eating meat and become a vegetarian or vegan, you have stopped by the right place.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;ll show how to make the switch without feeling that you have lost something but instead that you have gained a whole new lifestyle and one that is healthier and one that will extend your life and how to become a vegan or vegetarian.</p>\n<p>First, let me start off by saying that I&#8217;m not here to badger you about eating meat or harming animals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though I have been a vegetarian for about twenty-five years and ten of those years a vegan, I believe that we all must make our own choices and to each their own. Â However, not eating meat would help the environment and prevent the exploitation of animals and, that in itself is a great thing because, as humans, we have emotional attachments to animals and without a balanced planet, none of us can thrive.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vegetarianism has gone mainstream. Â Its cool to not eat meat. Â Some famous vegetarians are Paul McCartney, Tina Turner, Leonardo Da Vinci, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Socrates, Plato and I could go on and on, but you get the point.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\">HOW TO BECOME A VEGAN OR VEGETARIAN</span></h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\">What it means to be a vegetarian or vegan</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let&#8217;s define what a vegetarian is first. Â Vegetarians fall into three categories.</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Ovo-lactovegetarian</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Lactovegetarian</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Vegan</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ovo-lactovegetarians consume eggs and dairy products. Â Lactovegetarians eat dairy products but not eggs. Â Vegans do not eat any food of animal origin, even dairy products.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many times, I see people that say they are vegetarian but still eat fish or chicken. Â Fish and chicken are both considered meat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then there are some that instead of eating meat, they consume a lot of dairy products like cheese and butter, Â  This kind of diet has way too much saturated fat, and this is bad news for our health.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Honestly, if one were switching to vegetarianism for their health and they ate a diet like this then, it would be far wiser to keep eating lean beef which would decrease the amount of fat and cholesterol, however, keep reading because I don&#8217;t recommend this either. Â Also, remember the environment part and the exploitation of animals I talked about?</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\">&#8220;If you wanted to stop eating meat to gain better health then I would suggest that you stop all animal products including dairy.&#8221;</span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By reading that last sentence, basically did you feel a little uneasy and think to yourself that nothing left to eat? Â Or did you think that maybe you could do this and then cheat every once in while by having a nice juicy burger?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What about putting butter on your toast? Or having to go without cheese on your pizza? Â These are reasonable thoughts and questions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keeping with the idea of becoming a vegetarian or vegan for your health, one could sum up these questions and more by saying that a high fat, fiberless, plant deprived, toxin-laden, animal food diet, not only shortens life but turns our final years into an extremely unpleasant experience.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instead of enjoying our golden years we spend huge amounts of time and money running from doctor to doctor because of degenerative health problems.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Diseases like high blood pressure, circulatory problems, heart disease, kidney failure, stroke, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, brain disease, and much more. Â This lowers our quality of life and Â I&#8217;m saying this can mostly be avoided by my not eating animal products.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not to blame anyone but could we say that a lot of disease is self-inflicted? Â What if we ate a vegetarian diet, supplemented appropriately Â and exercised regularly? Â Then most of the suffering that we as humans could be avoided.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What&#8217;s the first step in changing your way of life by eliminating meat? Â I will give you the steps that I took to become a vegetarian and then a vegan.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Vegetarian/Vegan</span></h2>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>If you can&#8217;t stop eating meat all at once, then try eliminating one animal at a time until you get to the no meat part. Â This can easily be done within thirty days or so.</li>\n<li>Replace meat with plant proteins like <strong>beans, tofu, nuts, Quinoa, Lentils,Â Seitan,Â Tempeh, Green Peas, nut butters, veggie burgers, protein drinks, and beans and brown rice. Â </strong>These are only some examples of many.</li>\n<li>Start adding more fruits and veggies with your proteins.</li>\n<li>Eat more frequently in smaller meals.</li>\n<li>When dining out, order off the sides and veggie menu and eat plenty. Â You will see that you can eat way more than most and still not gain weight. Use the ratio of example number seven below.</li>\n<li>To avoid gaining weight, don&#8217;t swing to the other side and just eat carbs instead of meat. Â Many people go from eating meat to only eating lot&#8217;s of carbs and this will make you heavy and, it will not be good for your health.</li>\n<li>My food plate consists of fifty percent veggies, twenty-five percent good carbs and twenty-five percent protein.</li>\n<li>Contrary to what most people think, you do not need a lot of protein and, you will get protein in just about everything you eat so don&#8217;t worry about the nay sayers that ask &#8220;How will you get your protein?&#8221; Â Honestly, have you ever seen someone walking around with a protein deficiency? Â It could happen but it&#8217;s rare.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">NOTE: Â If you don&#8217;t want to eat like a vegan in the eight steps above, you can eat dairy as in a vegetarian. Â I did this for a while but honestly, dairy is not so good for us either. Â However, I think transitioning from vegetarian first to vegan is the easiest way to go.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me say that there are a whole lot of yummy vegetarian and vegan foods to eat. Â i practically live in Whole Foods and Pinterest has a ton of tasty dishes that you can save to an idea board.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can still have Mexican food, Italian food and everything else that you like. Â You simply replace the meat with another protein and that&#8217;s it! Â Simple right?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Pinterest boards that I have save me when I&#8217;m eating out and I sometimes don&#8217;t know what to eat or when, I&#8217;m craving something yummy. Â I simply scroll down on my phone and find creative meals and deserts to eat. Â Also, who carries around or probably even reads cookbooks anymore?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I usually pack snacks like bars and nuts and fruit so I&#8217;m not tempted to eat chips or other bad foods when I&#8217;m starving and believe me, I&#8217;m always eating because, well, I just love to eat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That&#8217;s the thing, you can eat a lot being a Vegan. Â People always ask me if I have a hollow leg ðŸ™‚ Â My business partner (who is a 6&#8217;2&#8243; man who body builds) says that I eat twice as much as him and that he always has to wait for me to finish all of my food when we go out! Â You can&#8217;t do that with other diets.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you go to Whole Foods and probably in your grocery store, you will see that there are deserts like rice ice-cream, almond ice-cream and so much more. Â Spend some time looking at all your options and trust me, there are way more than one can imagine. Â Not to mention all of the new Vegan protein options out there.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don&#8217;t worry, you won&#8217;t have to be rigid. Â As you go along, your journey will evolve and you will learn so many ways to keep your palate happy. Â Everything starts with the first step.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also recommend that you consume at least one smoothie per day when beginning the transition and keep them up if you enjoy them like I do!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I mix one scoop of vegan protein powder, 1/2 of a banana, almond milk and some ice and this is my post workout recovery smoothie. Â Tastes like a milkshake and so good.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For an antioxidant smoothie (which we should all do daily) I simply mix two handfuls of organic kale, 1/2 cup of the almond mile, probiotics, organic blueberries, ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, quarter banana, 1/2 of lemon or lime, a little ice and blend!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The above smoothie is amazing and I drink it every morning and in the course of three months, it has reduced my cholesterol and all of my lab tests have improved dramatically. Â You can always switch out the fruit for different flavors but always use the kale as your base.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before I go, I have to mention some amazing things about not eating meat and that is how you will transform. Â Your skin will change, you&#8217;ll have more energy (because you&#8217;re eating live things not dead things, am I right?) and, Â you will have better clarity. Â You will also probably lose a lot of fat too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And did I mention that you just might save the planet?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\">If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate.
