Lee says that it is estimated that  the release is up to five grams per year!! Scary..</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is why implants may hurt us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Silicone is a sensitizing agent, which means it initiates an autoimmune or hyper-immune process.&#8221; Which causes our own white blood cells to attack our bodies which can manifest itself as an autoimmune disorder like chronic fatigue, MS, or lupus.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It can also cause memory loss, poor concentration, arthritic pain, and other disorders.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Something worth thinking about before getting breast implants or maybe getting &#8220;un-implanted&#8221; if you have them and you have symptoms.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/8eef5ffbbc93c2e0984f131a61b97ee5/1a478/33635881_s-400x280.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"1c40f4b1-a7e9-58e4-8861-d3a2c9080b39"}}
