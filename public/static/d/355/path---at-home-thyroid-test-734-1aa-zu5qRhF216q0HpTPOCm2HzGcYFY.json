Don’t shake it down in the morning because this can raise your body temperature and the test won’t be accurate.</li>\n<li>When you wake up in the morning, put the thermometer in your armpit and leave it there for 10 minutes. Try and lie as still as you can.  Don’t get up or move as this too will increase your metabolic rate thus, raising your temperature.</li>\n<li>After the 10 minutes are up, record your temperature.</li>\n<li>Repeat this process for 3 – 5 days (at least 3 but preferably 5).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your BMT consistently falls below 97.8 F, you may have an underactive thyroid.  BMT Normally ranges from 97.8 F to 98.2 F.</p>\n<p>**If you have any kind of infection wait to take the test.</p>\n<p>If you fall below and you have some of the symptoms below, it may be time to see your doctor for a blood test.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of Hypothyroidism</p>\n<p>Fatigue</p>\n<p>Weakness</p>\n<p>Weight gain or increased difficulty losing weight</p>\n<p>Coarse, dry hair</p>\n<p>Dry, rough pale skin</p>\n<p>Hair loss</p>\n<p>Cold intolerance (you can&#8217;t tolerate cold temperatures like those around you)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>MYAGINGANDWELLNESS.COM</em></strong></p>\n<p>Muscle cramps and frequent muscle aches</p>\n<p>Constipation</p>\n<p>Depression</p>\n<h4>Irritability</h4>\n<p>Memory loss</p>\n<p>Abnormal menstrual cycles</p>\n<p>Decreased libido</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the body lacks sufficient thyroid hormone. Since the main purpose of thyroid hormone is to &#8220;run the body&#8217;s metabolism,&#8221; it is understandable that people with this condition will have symptoms associated with a slow metabolism. The estimates vary, but approximately 10 million Americans have this common medical condition. In fact, as many as 10% of women may have some degree of thyroid hormone deficiency.   Hypothyroidism is more common than you would believe, and millions of people are currently hypothyroid and don&#8217;t know it.”</p>\n<p>If you would like more information on treating thyroid conditions the natural way then, click on the resource link below:</p>\n<div class=\"fusion-page-title-secondary\">\n<div class=\"fusion-breadcrumbs\"><a href=\"https://www.cognitune.com/best-natural-thyroid-supplements/\"><span class=\"breadcrumb-leaf\">14 Best Thyroid Supplements: Natural Remedies for Hypothyroidism</span></a></div>\n<div> </div>\n</div>\n<p><em>source: http://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/thyroid/hypothyroidism-too-little-thyroid-hormone</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><br />Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-1024x840.png\" alt=\"7 step-by-step guide to look and feel amazing\" class=\"wp-image-8761\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-1024x840.png 1024w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-300x246.png 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-768x630.png 768w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-624x512.png 624w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM-600x492.png 600w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-1.33.27-PM.png 1060w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>7 step-by-step guide to look and feel amazing</figcaption></figure>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/f1c6ecd179a66f66a435591b6799393c/b1c9b/thyroidpic.jpg","width":275,"height":275}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cee0e8b8-4624-5c08-a30a-b6877708eeae"}}
