These nutrients are:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Amino Acids</u></strong> which are enzymes and enzymes are proteins.  These proteins are building blocks.  It is best to get these by consuming whole grains and beans rather than by consuming meats.  Meat and other animal based products are acidic and they cause free radicals in the body, whereas whole grains and beans do not.  Plant based foods are neutralizers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Complex Carbohydrates </u></strong>provide energy to our cells.  Again, unrefined, whole grains and beans offer the best quality.  Don’t be fooled by natural sugars because they undermine the cells ability to regenerate by fueling your body with junk instead of clean fuel.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Essential Fatty Acids</u></strong> are the fat vitamins that serve as building blocks for our cells membranes.  They are free radical killers and they enhance our body’s immune system.  Essential fatty acids are used by the body as an anti-inflammatory protector.  Foods like seeds, beans and vegetables have minimal amounts of essential fatty acids however, for the optimal amount needed; we can supplement our diet with flax seed and borage oil.  Fish oil is another good source.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Vitamins and Minerals </u></strong>are needed to help with the chemical process of our bodies.  For example when we talk about antioxidants which are the scavengers that eat free radicals, we are relating to vitamins such as A, C and E.  With regard to minerals, these are cofactors that help our enzyme systems, thus helping our enzymes perform the tasks necessary to renew our cells.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Phytochemicals </u></strong>These are the difference between basic nutrition and super nutrition. They are key factors in preventing heart disease and cancer.  Phytochemicals are only found in plant foods.  The brighter the food colors the better.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are approximately 100 trillion cells that make up the human body.  The body needs food to generate energy.  Our cells try to stay healthy.  When we don’t take care of them, we are fighting against their natural ability to heal themselves.  They greatly need our help in the process.  Every cell in the body is dependent upon key nutrients.  When we don’t feed our body with the right nutrients and, when key nutrients are not available, a cell may become compromised.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/9cee7fb59d1816a8b6e290855492c3a9/1a478/42354677_s-400x280.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"51a6df46-9baa-55d3-89da-92be9ac7e8a8"}}
