Does he really like you or does he have someone else?&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wanted to tell her what I really thought and that was that he probably liked her but, he either didn&#8217;t wan&#8217;t a relationship with her or that, he does have another person he is seeing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So I told her to move on because if someone is not giving you what you need and moreover, when your intuition is asking you questions, then you already know the answer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was thinking about making this blog post about dating at middle-age and how difficult it is but then, I thought that, it&#8217;s really not so much about age is it?  I think this question can come up at any age.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When someone is not in to you or they have other issues in their lives, it&#8217;s not hard to take it personally especially when you really like someone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think the middle-age part comes in when you are limited in the people that are available to date or mostly likely, the ways to meet people to date.  Where do people that are over 50 meet these days?  Dating websites?  If so, and you&#8217;ve honestly found a good guy, please, email me at theresaskrobanek@yahoo.com to tell me your story.  I would love to share it with other women 🙂</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So when you do find someone that you like and who makes you feel wanted but something is not right, sometimes you don&#8217;t want to listen to your inner voice telling you the truth.  And sometimes that truth is saying &#8220;move on because you deserve better.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is it that he&#8217;s just not that into you?  Truthfully, who cares?  It&#8217;s not your problem.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We only have so much time and if we waste it wondering and worrying about someone else having the ability to direct our lives, including our loves lives, then we are losing valuable time that could be used as open space for someone that does really love you. You can&#8217;t find that person if you&#8217;re tied up trying to change someone who will never be with you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;m not a relationship expert and really, is there such a thing?  Everyone is vulnerable and that&#8217;s the great thing.  It&#8217;s good to give 100% percent of yourself to someone. If they take advantage of it, it&#8217;s not your fault.  Just like if someone cheats, it&#8217;s an issue with themselves.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now-a-days, it seems like people and relationship are disposable so that, with all of the technology, we can unlike, unfriend or block someone is a split second.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like they say, &#8220;if it doesn&#8217;t come easy, it&#8217;s not worth having?&#8221; Well, I know there are things in life you have to work for but, in the beginning of a relationship if you have ask questions such as my friend did then, I believe that you will ask these questions the entire time that you in the relationship and, this is an indicator that the relationship won&#8217;t last therefore, why waste time and just move on.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do you really care if he likes you?</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"03678dc4-bcb4-547a-a304-5f5df4d3bcef"}}
