Â My thinking is that I would take it for the same reasons I used to take fish oil.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fish oil has a ton of health benefits, and one is that it thins your blood. Â Aspirin is made from the bark leaves of a willow tree and has been around for a very long time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aspirin has many benefits, and the most powerful medical advantage is its ability to reduceÂ cardiovascular catastrophes such as heart attacks and strokes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As I said, I started taking a baby aspirin a few weeks ago. Â I noticed that the fine lines and wrinkles on my skin (face and body) had diminished and the skin on my face looked relatively younger than it did before.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before my mother-in-law passed away a couple of years ago, I noticed that she didn&#8217;t have a wrinkle or a line on her face at seventy-four years old.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I remember asking her about everything that she consumed, did and, what pills she took if any. Â She told me she took aspirin every day but, at the time I didn&#8217;t think anything of it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Last Friday, I went to dinner with my father-in-law who is eighty-one, and I noticed that he didn&#8217;t have one line on his face or any wrinkles anywhere. Â Not even sagging skin!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I asked him if he spent a lot of time in the sun. Â Hoping that he would say no and, that would be the reason he looked so young but, he said he lived in the sun and never wore sunscreen in his life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, living in Texas, we get some serious sun. Â In the past, I baked in the California sun then, moved to Texas and, in the Winter I used tanning beds and, in the Summer, I baked on the Texas beach some more!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Is aspirin a hidden beauty secret?</span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can imagine how much I have damaged my skin and at about age 40 or so, it was showing big time! Â I turned 50 a couple of months ago, and this is the age where everything you&#8217;ve ever done wrong tends to show up! Â Kids if you&#8217;re listening, wear sunscreen. I should have listened.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, when my father-in-law said that he too takes aspirin every day, I decided to do some research for myself to see if my skin was changing because of the aspirin?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is what I found:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Inflammation takes its toll on your skin in a variety of ways such as acne, rosacea and visible signs of aging, like wrinkles and sagging skin. Collagen is key to keeping your joints and your skin functioning younger; by boosting your skin structure, collagen helps it to look full, smoother and elastic. When that structure breaks down, your skin starts to sag, wrinkle and look less vibrant. High levels of inflammation also cause a faster rate of collagen breakdown, which accelerates the aging &#8220;look.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Source: (http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2013/12/17/take-aspirin-at-night-to-reap-its-health-and-beauty-benefits)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To be honest with you too, my stomach tends to be a little upset lately. Â I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s because of the aspirin. However, those little aches and pains that I used to get are almost nonexistent lately.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think I will complete a cycle of one month to see how it goes and probably check with my doctor too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Please don&#8217;t be like me and begin an aspirin routine without checking with your doctor. Â It could be detrimental to your health especially if you&#8217;re on blood thinners.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is aspirin a hidden beauty secret?
