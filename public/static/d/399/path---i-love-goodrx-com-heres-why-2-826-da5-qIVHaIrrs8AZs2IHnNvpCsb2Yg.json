Here&#8217;s why!","content":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">I love GoodRx.com</span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I love GoodRx.com!! Here&#8217;s why! If you read this blog, you probably know that I write fifty-percent about health issues and the other half about anti-aging and, aging issues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;ve also written a book about &#8220;The secret to getting products and procedures cheap&#8221; and in it, I tell you how to get these for less than retail.  In one chapter (the products) I write about how I found Retin-A online at Canadapharmacy.com and, up until yesterday, that was my go-to place to get it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you don&#8217;t know what Retin-A is, I will give you a quick explanation and move on.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;What is Retin-A? Retin-A (tretinoin) is a form of vitamin A that helps the skin renew itself and is used to reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles and mottled skin discoloration, and to make rough facial skin feel smoother.&#8221; (http://www.drugs.com/retin-a.html)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I couldn&#8217;t agree more with the statement above as I have been using Retin-A for about twenty years and it has really changed my skin.  That said, you can&#8217;t get it without a prescription and even worse, most (if not all) insurance plans don&#8217;t cover it because of its cosmetic use.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So until I found canadapharmacy.com, I was paying retail about $275.00 for a tube of Retin-A that only lasted me about six weeks (if that).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let&#8217;s be real here, I&#8217;m turning 50 next month, and I&#8217;ve seriously done some sun damage, and I need this stuff everywhere!  I can&#8217;t be skimping on a product that works because of its price!  With canadapharmacy.com I paid about $95.00, and I was happy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The downside was that I had to wait a few weeks for them to mail it but, so long as I ordered it before running out of what I had, I was good.  But that&#8217;s the thing, I didn&#8217;t always stay on top of it, and I ended up having to pay retail a lot just to use Retin-A consistently.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now is where GoodRx.com comes in!  I came across their website by accident, and on their website, they have a search bar, and I put the name Retin-A in, and they came back with prices of five or so pharmacy&#8217;s in my area with competing prices!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I almost fell out of my chair because not only was the price $50.00 at CVS but, the tube size was double!  I thought this was too good to be true.  You know, the old bait and switch thing?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I figured I didn&#8217;t have anything to lose and I downloaded the coupon on my phone, took my prescription to CVS, they scanned the coupon on my phone and, done!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pharmacy clerk told me these sweet words &#8220;$50.00, and it will be ready in fifteen minutes!&#8221;  I stood there like I had won something or that I needed to feel guilty because I was kind of ripping them off somehow.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dumb way to think right?  Since the drug companies rip-off us consumers but, that is another blog post, and I won&#8217;t let my ADHD kick in right now!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I couldn&#8217;t believe it!  I happen to have another prescription for skin bleach (you know to lighten all the sun damage on my legs too!), and the clerk downloaded another coupon for me from GoodRx.com and, the cost was $20.00!  I have been paying 69.00 dollars for the same product!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Long story short ( I know, none of my stories are short), if you have any prescription, covered by insurance or not, run it through GoodRx.com and check out the cash/coupon price of competing pharmacies.  You just might be surprised at how much money you will save.</p>\n<p>I figure I&#8217;m saving a couple ofDown load of.. hundred dollars a month to do what I want wi. That&#8217;s exciting, and for that, this is why I love GoodRx.com.</p>\n<p>(this is not a sponsored post)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate.  I have created a six-step course called &#8220;The Rejuvenation Program&#8221; </em></span></h2>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em> You can check it out by clicking this link: <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.therejuvenationprogram.com/\">http://www.therejuvenationprogram.com</a></span></em></span></h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_8361\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8361\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8361\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png\" alt=\"The Rejuvenation Program\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-768x644.png 768w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-624x523.png 624w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-600x503.png 600w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program.png 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8361\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Rejuvenation Program</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/c8e4fb8f5182aa735c96f1a86f6d4059/990e0/f4cd7e7c96a348ec82897e1ce7c9f963.jpg","width":278,"height":278}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"8838ebe8-c609-5e81-8cfa-da206feb40cb"}}
