{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"PROCRASTINATION","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">PROCRASTINATION</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s kind of almost the New Year so I told my son he should make a New Year’s resolution to stop procrastinating. He looked at me, but said nothing and continued to postpone even the thought of it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My son is a young man who makes his life a lot more difficult than it has to be by procrastinating. No matter what it is in his life, a speeding ticket, homework, an appointment, whatever, he will wait until the very last minute to do what he needs to do to get where he needs to be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He does no research, no prep work and wonders why his life is always chasing him. His life is always in chaos as he lives through the consequences of procrastinating, both internal, by feeling and being anxious, and external, by having to turn in sub-par homework, forgetting about the speeding ticket and having to spend twice as much time showing up for court. And, let’s not forget the financial circumstances that come along with procrastinating.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The worse thing is he doesn’t see it. He doesn’t believe he procrastinates, but blames everyone and everything around him. I see it, others see it, but he does not, and no matter how much I gently try to show him his ways and explain that his life can be much easier, he only sees and believes what he wants to.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s disheartening, especially for a mother, to watch someone we care about go through pain and know there is nothing we can do about it, even when we know there is a solution. Like anything else though, he will have to experience the pain before he can see the light. I just hope it doesn’t take a lifetime.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The one thing he does have is a beautiful spirit, and I hope he doesn’t take too long so that his beauty can shine through. If he takes too long procrastinating, he will always be distracted and others will never be able to see the real man inside. I have seen, too many times, those who needlessly suffer by their own doing when a shift in thinking is all they need.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Think of all the money and time it costs us when we procrastinate. I have already stated what my son does, and he lives at home. I wonder how he will be able to survive on his own. If he doesn’t decide to change his habit of postponing and delaying his life, he may endure a life of financial disaster, among other things.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is not unusual for a procrastinator to delay paying their bills and incurring late charges. It is not likely he will save money because he will probably justify in his mind that “he will do it later.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are many more examples of what one can do to create a damaging financial future, because we may be a financial procrastinator and we have definite mental hurdles to overcome. We may postpone our taxes, even if we’re due a refund. We may lose discounts because we didn’t pay on time. When you think about it, just the financial part alone is enough to make one stop being reactive and start being proactive.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Procrastination has its emotional effects, too. We can feel so overwhelmed and over-burdened by waiting until the last minute that we do nothing at all. Even depression is linked to being a procrastinator.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you feel you are hopeless, you are not. No one is beyond the ability to stop. It doesn’t mean that you were born lazy, unless you want to be, or that you can’t be an efficient person. Procrastination is just a habit. Hear me here: it’s JUST A HABIT and nothing more. It is up to you to make the choice to change.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are not born with a condition called “procrastination,” we merely create a habit. We choose to procrastinate because that’s what we do and we get used to it. There are no drugs that will keep us from doing it; it’s just us who must become aware of what we are doing and break the habit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We don’t need to make more of procrastination than what it is and, again, it is only a habit that we choose. We can all overcome procrastination. How do we do this? We look for the reason why we procrastinate in the first place so we can create a strategy to turn our life around. It’s as simple as viewing the things we need to do as painful, rather than enjoyment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">­­­Everyday, people quit all kinds of habits, like nail biting, smoking cigarettes, over eating and so many more. You may say these actions are addictions, and I would agree, but they all started with an initial habit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The good news is procrastinating is not an addiction. I am not a doctor, but I would bet that you don’t need therapy for it unless you are also clinically depressed, and that may mean you procrastinate because you have lost the drive to do more than what is necessary. Even so, this can be treated too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just so you know, there is no quick fix for procrastination. Like any other habit, we will not wake up one morning and say, “Today I will never procrastinate again.” Because, even though we may say it and we may sincerely mean it, we are creatures of habit and we usually go back to who we are.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is true that very few people change (remember the resistant thinking I wrote about in an earlier post?), however, people can and do change if and when they really want to.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>If they really want to</em> are the key words here. Just like anything we need to do, we have to want to do it and, until then, like my son, nothing will ever change on its own. Life will keep moving, but your life will never transform until you do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"e8156c11-85ec-5e28-9bf2-df0eb91c8ae0"}}
