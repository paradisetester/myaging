Compared to products, cosmetic procedures are not a commodity so finding bargain cosmetic procedures may not be a good thing.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We’re talking about wounding the skin, and this doesn’t necessarily correlate with cheaper. However, there is no reason you can’t call around to your local dermatologists or plastic surgeons to find out what procedures cost.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Then you can compare for yourself. I pick three or four good doctors or medical spas in my area and check their prices, and then I get on their email list. Before long, I get discounted offers of up to thirty percent off their procedures.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s worth it to compare and get on their lists. You’ll get weekly emails from all the places you signed up at to compare the prices. You can even call your favorite doctor or spa and ask if they will match prices. They do it all the time!</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong><i>Botox</i></strong> – You should get Botox as a prevention measure. You may only need twenty units or so just to prevent frown lines or lines that may be forming between your nose and eyes called the elevens.</span></h4>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You can also have Botox used on your crow’s feet (the lines around your eyes). This helps tremendously. If you need thirty or forty units and you can’t afford it all at once, then get ten units every few weeks until you get all areas covered.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost varies, but I have paid up to fourteen-dollars a unit. When I got on the doctors’ or Spa lists, I received discounts, and now I only pay about nine to ten dollars per unit. That’s a pretty good savings. Some doctors will have a buy two get one free promotion.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Also, there are competing products to Botox. Because they’re competing with Botox, they may be less money. Botox, which is owned by Allergen, has a loyalty program, as well. I recently received a coupon for $100 off the total cost of my Botox!</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This program is called <a href=\"https://www.brilliantdistinctionsprogram.com/\">BRILLIANT DISTINCTIONS</a>. Make sure you sign up or have your doctor/injector sign you up and every time you get Botox or another Allergan product such as Juvederm, etc. you will receive points towards your next service.</span></h4>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I almost got my most recent Botox for free by doing this.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Chemical Peel</i> – A chemical peel is great for removing the surface layer of the skin. The process wounds the skin, which causes it to heal itself by creating new collagen. A chemical peel has different strengths so the cost will vary.  You can do it at home.  Check out my course <a href=\"https://how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com\">(https://how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com)</a></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">In most states, a chemical peel will cost about $150 to  $200 in a doctor’s office. You’ll want to continue having peels, as they will help create beautiful skin with less texture and, diminish fine lines.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You can do them yourself, but start with a low strength.  Unfortunately, in my learning process, I bought a fifty-percent TCA peel online (I should not have been able to purchase this strength peel without a license), and I did some serious damage to my skin. Damage so bad that, I have to hide the scars every day for three years. It’s not the worth the risk to try and skip ahead rather than to start slow or let a professional do it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you want to do your peel, start with a small patch of skin to see how it will react. I do my own peels every two to four weeks, usually no more than twice a month. You can go to <i>skin-peel.com</i> to find them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>The secret to making peels comfortable is while they are on your face, use your blow dryer on the cool setting or, use a small hand fan pointed at your face. It makes a difference.</i></span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Retin-A</i> – A prescription is required, but Retin-A is fantastic!! “Retin-A (tretinoin) is a topical preparation of vitamin A, which has antioxidant properties, just like the vitamin by itself. It’s an acid derivative of retinol (vitamin A).</span></h4>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The important aspect is the effectiveness of what Retin-A does. Studies have shown that Retin-A can help reduce wrinkles, reduce acne, exfoliate dead skin cells and redistribute melanin. Melanin redistribution results in lighter, more even skin color. Thus Retin-A is often used to treat skin discolorations caused by excessive sun exposure.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have sensitive skin, it may not work for you, it may be too harsh, but there are alternatives with lesser concentrations.  I would still try to mix a little every other night with my favorite cream. Just don’t give up. This stuff is amazing!  I heard it said that anyone with a pulse and a credit card should use Retin-A.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Get Retin-A for less at GOODRX.COM</span></strong></p>\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Teeth Whitening</i> – This makes a huge difference. You could have perfect skin and straight teeth, but if your teeth are stained and dull, no one will notice anything else. If you have bright, white teeth, you’ll look better, and younger, and feel better too.  </span></h4>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost in my state is about $100.00, which is down from $500 when I first had it done. There are many good ones over the counter too.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">IPL-, which stands for intense pulse light or flash lamp therapy, is a noninvasive and non-ablative treatment that uses high intensity pulses of visible light to improve the appearance of birthmarks, port wine stains, broken facial veins, rosy cheeks, rosacea, red thread veins of the legs, freckles, age spots, facial lines and wrinkles, and the removal of unwanted dark hair. The procedure is referred to as photo rejuvenation and requires a series of treatments.  I can tell you personally that it doesn&#8217;t work on legs 🙁</span></h4>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost nationally runs about $100 to $300. You should only need a few treatments. I have seen it as low as $80 per treatment if you agree to three or more.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> It’s important to know that brown spots on the body are hard to remove.  I add a skin bleach and put a little of my skin peel on each spot when I do peels on my face.  It takes a long time and staying out of the sun maintain my treatment.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Dermapen or Micro-Needling – “ Sterile surgical stainless micro-needles pierce the skin leading to apoptosis of cells in the dermis.” “What is Apoptosis? Apoptosis or programmed cell death is when a cell essentially commits suicide. This process is natural, controlled and routine. Little inflammation is caused.” “The Dermapen uses eleven, 33-gauge micro needles to stimulate the dermis. Needles vertically pierce the skin to enhance rejuvenation results. Small holes are punctured at a rate of 1000/second. </span><span class=\"s2\">This proliferation of the body’s tissue continues to release growth factors from fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and monocytes.”</span></h4>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Note: I have had <i>Dermapen</i> about six times and it works wonders. It’s comparable to lasers like Fraxel but without all the downtime and expense. Many doctors will give you a discount if you buy a package of four or more. You can save hundreds by doing this. I paid $150 per treatment vs. $300 – $350 by buying the package.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Juvederm</i> – Juvederm is an injectable filler consisting mostly of hyaluronic acid. It’s used to fill in areas to smooth out wrinkles and deep folds on the face and can last up to a year. You can pay anywhere from $400 a syringe to $800. I pay only about $500 – $550 depending on the specials the doctors have. Currently, my doctor has a buy one get one half off, and I can save the second one for a later time. At first, you may need two but, as your stem cells work, you will need less later.  In my case, it lasts about six months.  Remember, you get points for this with the Brilliant Distinctions Program.</span></h4>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">These are certainly not all of the basic cosmetic procedures available, but these tend to be the least expensive and the least invasive. These procedures do well concerning anti-aging and reversing past damage.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">They’re also a good alternative to going under the knife. I think one day these products and procedures will be affordable for all of us</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">With today’s technology, the need for doctors to perform invasive procedures will diminish so they’ll be more eager to lower procedure costs to attract more patients. I hope that you get the best skin possible without having to figure out where you will get the money.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Let’s face it, many of us want to take care of ourselves but, products and procedures can be a little expensive.</span></p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1 class=\"p10\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">How to be happy 😀</span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8169\" style=\"width: 421px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8169\" class=\"wp-image-8169 \" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2459-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"How to be happy\" width=\"411\" height=\"274\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2459-300x200.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2459-768x512.jpg 768w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2459-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2459-624x416.jpg 624w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2459-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8169\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How to be happy at mid-life</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">First let me start off with I’m no Doctor Phil, Life Coach or anything more than just a person who has always had a pretty good life but, felt like there was something missing a lot of the time.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">I felt happy most of the time but true, however, long-term happiness, eluded me. Some may call this depression, but for me, it wasn’t.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And, it wasn’t that there was always something greater and better that I was chasing either.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I know about watering my own grass.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">I wasn’t looking to escape myself and I certainly never wanted to be anyone but me.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Sure I could be prettier, smarter and have nicer stuff but really, does any of that make someone happy for very long?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Pretty fades, smarter becomes irrelevant, and you can’t take stuff with you.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">But, I always had this little hole that I couldn’t fill.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I got some therapy; I had my share of boyfriends to fill it and, I’ve spent my way through pretty good sums of money only to end up right back to where I had always been.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Back to me the person with the hole.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">So when I turned fifty life clicked for me.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I finally got it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I was happy all along but, I was creating my unhappiness by the disappointment that I created about, all of the ways that I thought life should be.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">The truth is, life is half chance and half results.</span></strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">Blame it on the media, magazines, reality shows, parents or whatever but, <strong>how to be happy</strong> comes back to whether we are comfortable in our skin, at any stage in life. Some are luckier than others and get this sooner than I did at fifty but, never the less, I got it before it was too late.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Better late than never.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">That was it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I was never comfortable in my skin.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I figured at age fifty; if I wasn’t comfortable by now, I’d better figure out how to get that way or figure out an exit plan because I certainly wasn’t going to allow myself to grow old and bitter.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">Moreover, I didn’t want to walk around thinking a part of me was missing for the next half of my life.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">It doesn’t matter what age you are, how to be happy is about being comfortable in your skin.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It’s not about comparing yourself to anything other than the person that you were yesterday.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Not tomorrow because, you don’t have that day yet and, you may never get it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">Another thing that has changed me is the acceptance that life is beautiful and, it’s quick and, those that we love are here one day and gone the next.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Like both my mother and my brother.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">Let me say that when you forget that your mom has passed away but, you pick up the phone to call her and then you realize that she is no longer there, not today, not tomorrow, not ever again, life becomes pretty sobering.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are fortunate to have not lost a parent, please, call them every day because, when you do,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>you’ll feel a kind of pain the hurts beyond what you thought was even possible (sorry. I know you don&#8217;t need me to tell you that).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">When we realize and contemplate that we too only have a short amount of time, we don’t have much time other than to be happy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It is our duty to ourselves to give ourselves this gift. This is what most people will remember you for.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Not stuff, not your looks, not how much money you had.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This is your true legacy.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">I know that really bad things happen in life and, these things will pass.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We will all die and so will the people we love.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We will have financial difficulties, and life will sometimes punch us so hard that it knocks the wind out and sometimes for longer than we had planned.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>But, life goes on with or without us, and that’s just how it is.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This is the acceptance part that we must do.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">I’m not here to give you a cheesy line about how grateful you should be.   Or that what you have others would probably kill to have.  I will say that you and I should take some time every day to realize how short life is and understand that, we don’t have a lot of time other than to live our lives to the fullest while we are here for the short time that we have.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">There is no magic to being happy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The secret is to accept the beautiful life that God has given, don’t over think, add a little gratitude and, keep smiling knowing that you have this day which may be your last.</span></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"p15\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Change is coming</span></h1>\n<h1 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #33cccc;\">READY FOR A CHANGE?</span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7494\" style=\"width: 416px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7494\" class=\"wp-image-7494\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18153601_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"406\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18153601_s-400x280-300x210.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18153601_s-400x280.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7494\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Time for a change. Live like you mean it.</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Change is a natural part of life and to resist it is futile. Changes occur all around us, and there is nothing we can do about it. Sometimes change is good and sometimes, as we feel a change, it may be uncomfortable, so we resist it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Even after all the resisting we do, there comes a time when we are ready for a change. When we accept it, we listen to our inner self, possibly the one that has been talking to us our whole lives, but only now are we listening.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s the voice that we have always wanted to hear but didn’t take its advice until now. It’s time for a change and with change comes healing and transformation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The key to making a change is wanting to do it. Even if we fail on our journey, the more we keep trying, the higher the chance is that we will succeed. I don’t need a diet to deprive myself. As soon as I say diet, I get a negative emotion that pulls me in the opposite direction, and I automatically go right back to the way I was or sometimes worse.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Sometimes instead of feeling good, I feel bad, and this is what I focus on. I realize that I don’t need to live like this regularly. The fact is, I don’t need to diet; I need to eat better. We as a society put so many restrictions on ourselves and when we don’t succeed we punish ourselves, and the cycle continues.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I need to make a lifestyle change, that’s all. If you want to make a difference, make a change, but don’t do it because of others. You know what will and will not make you a better person. This is the only change we need to make.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There is no one solution for change. Everyone is different, and it is through trial and error that we succeed. I tend to go in circles when I don’t know how to make a change. This wastes so much time that I often stop trying and start again later, only to go in circles again.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Once I fall, I know why I fell, and I don’t fall that way again.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> No sense in kicking ourselves when we are down. It doesn’t make sense to be defeated before we start. I have wasted a lot of time in my life, not by trying and failing, nope, I have lost more time not doing anything at all.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are sitting on the fence or the couch for that matter and you know it’s time for a change, what are you waiting for?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Momentum kicks in in any situation when we get started. Think about when you were in school, and you had a term paper due. You may have been the kid who waited until the last minute because you didn’t have a topic and you didn’t know where to begin. Painfully, you waited until the last minute and got started the night before or the morning that it was due.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s not so much that time isn’t on your side, its momentum that kicks in and you get on a roll. Once you are in this phase, you are blowing and going, and you see the end in sight. It’s just like change. You realize that it’s not so hard and wonder why you didn’t do it sooner. We make things harder than they need to be.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong>Elements of change:</strong></span></em></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Readiness, barriers, and relapse should all be expected on the road to change. We only make a change when we are ready to. I want my mom to stop smoking and take care of herself, but she is not ready to and at seventy-one, she probably never will be. (She passed away last year).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I can’t do anything about it, only accept it, and she has to own it and pay the consequences. I spent a lot of years trying to get her and others to change for the better, and I was always met with resistance. It wasn’t until I came to terms with the truth that no one will ever change unless they want to, not because I wanted them to.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Why I needed someone to be other than who they wanted to be, I don’t know. It’s obvious when health is an issue; you want your loved ones to be around; however, if this is not what they want, it’s no longer a problem for me. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">When I stopped preaching to my mother, our relationship got much better. She was happy with who she was, and if this is what she chose for her time on this earth, then it is what it is.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">By the way getting older is also about death and losing the ones that you love.  I took my momma back home to San Diego and gave her a burial at sea.  It was beautiful.  If want, you can check out the three-minute video here.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiqQrwy5crg\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiqQrwy5crg</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Barriers to change are other obstacles to overcome when we want to change. What is preventing us from changing? I will go back to my mother’s story (last time I promise). Why wouldn’t she want to stop smoking and get healthy so she can live longer and have a better quality of health? </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I would surmise that she didn&#8217;t want to make the change because, in her mind, it would have been more painful to live without cigarettes than it is to live with them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s important to know that change happens gradually. There will be a relapse, and there may be discomfort. Very few of us are so strong-willed that we won’t ever have a relapse.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There will always be factors begging for our attention.

And, we have so many cells.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When you get down to it, why wouldn’t we help our body fight against this mass attack by consuming antioxidants and avoiding the things that cause free radicals in the first place?  See when we let our antioxidants fall below optimal then free radicals have the upper hand.  After a billion hits here and there, now you have severe cellular damage.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This type of damage not only causes disease but it’s the quickest way to aging.  Again, how to counter this is to take in generous amounts of antioxidant foods and supplements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong>If you would like, I have a &#8220;7 Day Rejuvenation Program&#8221; that you can download right here:</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8213\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8213\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8213\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-04-08-at-2.54.05-PM-300x216.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-04-08-at-2.54.05-PM-300x216.png 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-04-08-at-2.54.05-PM-768x552.png 768w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-04-08-at-2.54.05-PM-1024x736.png 1024w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-04-08-at-2.54.05-PM-650x470.png 650w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-04-08-at-2.54.05-PM-624x449.png 624w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-04-08-at-2.54.05-PM-600x431.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8213\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How to rejuvenate your body in seven days without being rigid</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Don&#8217;t worry.

Relationships at middle age</p></div>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Ah yes, the love lives of women.  I can’t tell you how many times I hear women say, “There are just no good ones left,” or worse, “I don’t want a man.” Is this true? Even when in a relationship, married or not, we can get bored.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I’m not saying we need a man to be happy; I wonder if some women quietly settle for not having one. I realize that at middle age, there doesn’t appear to be many single and qualified men out there and that the men we are married to have grown to be a bit unexciting and predictable.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I also realize the dating world is a different world out there. I hear stories from women who say men don’t want to commit or are disrespectful. I hear about men having multiple girlfriends and lying to them about seeing other people.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I listen to others say how lonely they are and have settled for mediocre instead of holding out for the right guy. I may not understand, but I feel for those who would like to have a partner, someone to love and to love them, but it’s just not happening. I feel for those who have given up, never expecting to find love at all.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Even those of us who are married, life isn’t always perfect. We go through times of doubt, and question whether we want to be married, too. I think one thing is constant and that is that, the older we get, the more settled we are with ourselves. Therefore, we may be or are okay with not having a partner, and we learn to create our happiness and, more importantly, we own it, and it feels good.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Today, I took lunch to a past neighbor who is elderly and just out of the hospital after hip replacement surgery. She lives alone, has basically no family, lost her job due to age discrimination, and it is highly unlikely she will ever find another job at her age.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">She has no money except Social Security and spends a dollar a day at the Dollar General store for soup to survive. I asked her if she wished she was married and how it felt being alone. I asked if she was afraid. She told me she would never want to be married for the sake of being married, and if she didn’t have passion for a man, then she wouldn’t want to just exist in a relationship like a lot of people do.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\">She also said she was very happy at this point in her life, and then genuinely laughed as though she was. The teacher has, yet again, appeared through her by showing me that, for all she doesn’t have, she is still authentically happy, while I wake up each day looking for what could be better in my life.</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p19\"><span class=\"s1\">This teacher has taught me to appreciate what I have and to stop looking for more and better. I already have it all, and there is nothing more or better that I need.<strong> That’s the secret: if you don’t need it, there is nothing missing.</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><i>BE YOUR BEST AT ANY AGE</i></span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7460\" style=\"width: 443px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7460\" class=\"wp-image-7460\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/39808977_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"433\" height=\"303\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/39808977_s-400x280-300x210.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/39808977_s-400x280.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7460\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Your best at any age</p></div>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i> </i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Who knows what the fountain of youth is? We all know that aging catches up with us very quickly. They say, the older you get, the faster you get old. It’s as though we wake up one day and the years have passed us by!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You’re rocking along in your life looking and feeling great and then suddenly, out of nowhere, reality hits you; you can’t do the same things or look the same as you did. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Contrary to what we have been told, there is things we can do to slow down the aging process and keep ourselves on top of our game, and to, as they say, “age gracefully.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">As far as I am concerned, beauty companies are liars! And we all know they are not anti-aging us, but putting moisture on top of our skin and taking our money. Like the Oil of Olay, commercial says, “Do you still have wrinkles even after the wrinkle cream is gone?” The fact of the matter is, we are going to go through many changes in our mind, body, and appearance.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Unless you have a fortune to spend on plastic surgery (even that doesn’t look good after a while), you will be like the rest of us women. Your skin will age, and your body fat will shift to places you would never have imagined and you will slow down.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Is it fair? No. Can we do much about it, very little? The sooner we accept that we will age no matter what, the sooner we can move along and find peace and look our best at any age for the age we are at the time. At this point in life, we are on the last third of our lives.  Living life to the fullest is all you should do now.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">If I could tell you one thing that will anti-age you, and it doesn’t cost you a dime, and it’s probably the closest to the fountain of youth you will ever know, would you want to know about it?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Of course, you do</i>, so here it is!!!  It&#8217;s called <strong>EXERCISE</strong>! That’s it! Exercise at least five days a week. You will keep your weight down and your butt where it is, and even improve upon it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It will keep the blood pumped to your skin giving you a natural glow. People lose thirty percent of their muscle strength between the ages of fifty and seventy, and then lose another thirty percent for each decade after that.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Alarming, if you think about it because we need good muscle tone. We need to work out for balance and mobility as we get older.  It will be even more important to maintain muscle tone as we become elderly.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The reason staying active is more important than ever is it keeps us coordinated, so we don’t fall and break a hip, and it keeps the neurons in our brains firing. We need to keep our brains active to avoid dementia and to remember things like names of people, which I am very bad at. You don’t have to hit the gym and run ten miles or take a cardio spinning class until you pass out either.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I’m simply talking about walking, riding a bike, swimming, or taking a dance class, and lift weights to keep your muscle tone and bones strong. Whatever you do, you must also wear sunscreen every day, as the sun is the number one reason we get wrinkles!  Just saying 🙂</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">For me, I work out, and I take in one gram of protein for every pound I weigh, and I also take supplements daily. Although I do have my bad habits, like drinking wine daily, I justify this by taking exceptionally good care of myself the rest of the time, as in eating organic, very little carbs and drinking a ton of water.  I not about being rigid either.  I would rather enjoy the time I have left and simply balance it out.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Don’t forget to go to the doctor yearly, and get your mammogram.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> Our cells are programmed genetically to die at a certain point and there is nothing we can do about that. However, don’t underestimate &#8220;environment versus biology.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p19\"><span class=\"s1\">We are in more control of our outcome then we give ourselves credit for. The goal may not be to live forever but to forever live a quality life while we are here.</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 class=\"p19\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">LETTING GO OF EMOTIONAL PAIN</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7440\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7440\" class=\"wp-image-7440\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/40438945_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"390\" height=\"273\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/40438945_s-400x280-300x210.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/40438945_s-400x280.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Letting go of emotional pain</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Sometimes our hearts are weak, and our spirits are broken, but, still, we get up and go about the day and push down the pain. Maybe we were born with spiritual pain, or we have unresolved issues that we haven’t let go of, and we hold them inside not knowing how to let go. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Some believe in past lives and that we are born with pain and this pain is a punishment from a past life.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">For those who are Christian, they don’t believe this, but believe that we can remove the pain by giving it to God. Give it to something or someone and let it go if you have it. It’s not worth holding on to. Without being mindful, we hold on to pain so tight that it leaves us exhausted.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> I am not saying things didn’t happen to you in your past. Maybe you can’t even remember or pinpoint anything. I couldn’t imagine some of the circumstances people have gone through and are still able to live each day.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I have had hardships, but I am blessed that my pain is not as deep as others.  All pain needs to be let go of, though. The point here is to give yourself the gift of seeking out help to rid yourself if you are in pain. Start fresh again, even if for only once in your life. Choose to be free.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Listen to your pain; it’s telling you something, telling you that you must do something about it. The problem is that we feel it, but we don’t acknowledge it. Just like a broken leg tells you it’s broken, your spirit also tells you it’s broken too.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The pain that we carry around could be minimal, or it could be monumental. I have heard that what doesn’t kill us, makes us stronger, and that suffering causes greatness. I don’t necessarily believe this as I believe it leaves pain wounds in our soul and, unless we intentionally choose to heal it, we have a problem.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Most of us think we are healing our pain by getting better at handling it. To solve your inner problems is to quit letting your mind mislead you. I don’t think time heals all wounds either. Time makes them a little easier to take, but we all know if we let ourselves go there, we can bring back the pain like it was day one. How we do this is by holding in that exact memory of when we first arrived at the pain. We can go back there again and again if we let ourselves.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When we think no one will love us and we are alone, or we will always be alone, or there will never be someone for us, we are dealing with our minds personal dilemma. When we do find someone, and the relationship doesn’t solve the issues that we have, we have an internal disturbance. We realize the void is still within us, and then we move onto something else because the pain is always there. But the real problem is we take our baggage wherever we go, and we want to give it to someone else to carry, all the while picking up more as we go along.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Freeing ourselves from pain is a matter of unloading the memory and detaching the connection we have to it and then allowing it to diminish. It will take time, and it will take a conscious effort to do it, but it can be done. If you have lost a loved one, you will have pain. In time it will get better. You will always have the good memories.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"> There are no boundaries that we must live in, just the ones we create.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p20\"><span class=\"s1\">Real growth means dealing with discomfort, like it or not. Many times the actions we take are to avoid something. Stop avoiding and don’t let issues upset you.

Especially if you do a workout or two during the week.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">9.  If you go out to eat, go directly to the salad menu and the protein menu.  Order one of each and put the dressing on the side.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Ditch the breading on the protein and the extras on the salad unless they are veggies.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I try and use lemon on my salad, and if I’m feeling deprived, I slightly dip my salad on the fork into the dressing.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">These are nine ways no to overeat.  Of course, there will be times and days when you just can’t help it but, if you stick to this plan, for the most part, you will lose weight and feel great</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I like to eat.  I hate being hungry.  I especially hate how my stomach hurts when I’m hungry.  I don’t like feeling light-headed either and, I hate looking for healthy food options when I’m starving.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"p22\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s5\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">11 Ways to curb your appetite </span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7577\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7577\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-7577\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4547024_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4547024_s-400x280-300x210.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4547024_s-400x280.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/2017/06/06/11-ways-to-curb-your-appetite/\">11 Ways to curb your appetite   click link to see the article here</a></p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Be prepared.  Always have a low-calorie meal/snack with you at all times so that as soon as you get that hungry feeling, you can eat!</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">2.  East small meals often.  I try and eat about five to six times a day.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">3.  Eat protein and veggies and try and keep it to no more than 300 calories each time.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">4.  Sip on hot cups of veggie broth throughout the day.  This warms and soothes the stomach and, provides lots of health benefits.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">5.  Drink a couple of dark green veggie smoothies during the day.  Throw a couple of hands full of kale, a hand full of blueberries, some almond milk and, Stevia Sweetener.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This will be about 80 calories or so, and you’ll get your greens and your fill.  Great for hair, skin, and nails too.  I know because I’ve seen my hair grow about three inches since doing this for the past nine months!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">For even better results, add in some probiotics (open a couple of capsules).  AMAZING!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">6.  When dining out.  Don’t let the server bring bread or any appetizer and then, eat the meal that you want but, ask for a to-go box right away and box half of your meal.  You can eat the other half later or the next day!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">7.  If you have to eat a lot (like I do) then SPIRALIZE! This is using an attachment to make spaghetti zucchini noodles and then cut up tomatoes, one teaspoon olive oil, salt, pepper, shredded basil and, a tablespoon of Parmesan cheese.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Heat in microwave for about two minutes.  It’s lovely and filling and, about 160 calories!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">8.  When you do eat a meal, consume lots of veggies.  I eat 80% veggies and then 20% protein.  Others will tell you to probably reverse this, and yes, protein does make you feel fuller, however, I think with regards to health and aging, we need those phytonutrients that plants provide rather than too much protein which is acidic to the body. Plants neutralize our body.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">9.  When you want to eat, step back and ask yourself if you are really hungry?  Is it habit, boredom or, are you hungry?  If you are then, go ahead and eat!  If you can wait, go do something for a while and come back to eating.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">10.  Always have small GO TO meals in your fridge or freezer to pop in the microwave, that way you won’t stand in pantry grazing and overeating.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">11.  Okay, number eleven is a mini list<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span> Hydrate, get enough sleep, drink hot green tea, take in a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, keep tempting food out of the house, use small plates for your meals.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This isn’t a diet of any kind.  Only mindful ways to keep you from overeating, eating when you’re not hungry or, binge eating because of boredom.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What I also do is, when I find myself constantly thinking about eating while at home, I take my keys, jump in my car and go to the mall and WALK around.  Of course, I always find something that I don’t need but, I’m working on that too.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This is how I keep the weight off and eat a ton! I love to eat.  Frankly, I wake up, and as soon as I open my eyes, I think about eating.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Today I went to lunch with my business partner and I ate a salad with Yogurt dressing, cabbage, spinach, vegetable soup, salsa, and tea sweetened with Stevia and, that was my second meal of the day!  I usually eat about five times a day plus snacks.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, my business partner had chicken fried steak, mash potatoes, and water. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Who do you think ate more calories?  Not me. My business partner did of course. Sure, I ate more food but not even as many calories as he did.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">See that’s the thing, you can eat a lot (and I mean a lot) may be more than you probably eat now and still maintain or lose weight.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Whenever I go out to eat with others, they ask me if I have a hollow leg.  Really?  I wish.  I don’t have a hollow leg, and I wasn’t blessed with a high metabolism either.  My mother told me ” You were born the big-boned one in the family” (thanks mom). In fact, does anyone have a high metabolism anyways?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Sure, there are some exceptions to the rule but when it comes right down to it, we either eat too much or we don’t. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Working out is good but not as important as what you eat.  If all we needed to do to stay thin was to work out thirty minutes to an hour per day, then we could eat all the food we wanted right? Wrong.  Not even athletes can do this.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The thing is that it’s the type of food and in what combinations that we eat.  Going back to my business partner, a chicken fried steak paired with mash potatoes, that will put weight on us. Not to mention that the side effects of that type of food are probably not good for our health.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">However, this blog post is not about lecturing anyone on the ways to eat for better health (although eating this way will make you more healthy).   Nope, this blog post is about showing you the ways that you can eat a ton of food, never be hungry and most importantly, satisfy your taste buds.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Let’s face it; no one likes to eat boring food or starve themselves.  Honestly, when I don’t eat a lot, I’m a bit grouchy, and no one likes a grouch.  I could never just not eat because my stomach hurts and I get a bit spacey. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> I love people and food too much because food should be enjoyed.  No one ever had fun while out to dinner with someone who pretends not to be hungry.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">  Why fight it!

This will not only eliminate waste but hydrate you as well.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you hate water, combine lemon and a little plant sweetener called Stevia.  Drink decaf, green tea too.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Be sure not to drink all of your water at once because this can be dangerous.  Drink it during a 24 hour period.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p61\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s5\">Avoid processed foods and try to eat clean.</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></strong><span class=\"s1\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Try not to eat any processed foods. That means don’t eat any food from your pantry, with the exception of certain proteins (see below).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Eat fresh food like vegetables, low glycemic fruits and, nuts.  Try and eat as natural as possible without overcooking.  Like raw, smoothies, salads, or, steamed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Eliminate the following:  caffeine (or cut in half), sugar, flour and, alcohol.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Eat whole foods.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p62\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s5\">Your goal is to seek out and consume antioxidants.</span></strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Eat bright colored veggies.  They are full of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals and, your liver loves these because phytochemicals help activate liver enzymes that remove harmful substances from our bodies.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">They also help with inflammation (a big factor in disease) and nourish your gut.</span></p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Limit meat consumption but get protein from other sources like tofu, nuts, beans, Quinoa, seeds, lentils, Tempeh, pea and rice protein, nut milks, chickpeas, etc.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Besides meat having a ton of growth hormones and antibiotics that you don’t need, meat can contribute to disease and stay undigested in our systems for longer than we need.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You don’t need to stop eating meat if you don’t want to, however, for this 3-day detox and rejuvenation plan, try to let your body rest from having to work too hard.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p62\"><span class=\"s5\">Try and eat organic</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s unfortunate that in order to eat healthily we have to pay more for organic but, it’s the way it is and your body has to choose between cleaning off the pesticides or nourishing your body.  When you eat organic, you give your detox system a break, so that it can work on giving your body the nutrients that it needs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you can’t afford organic, then wash the heck out of fruits and veggies when you consume the skin.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<h1 class=\"p62\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s5\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Eat fermented foods</span></h1>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Kimchi, miso, sauerkraut, tempeh all offer payoffs because they help your gut fend off bad bacteria and provide good fiber.  Fiber is what we are also going for.  We need to mop up all the bad cholesterol and eliminate waste.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I get mine in the produce aisle where they have the vegetarian cold foods.  You can always get these at Whole Foods too.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p61\"><span class=\"s5\">The last step in our 3-day detox and rejuvenation plan is to get it all out! </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Being regular is your most important pathway.  Even if you go every day, chances are you could go a little more.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Extra and undigested food is processed through the intestines and we don’t seem to get rid of nearly half as much as we take in!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Try Smooth Move tea, one tea bag each day of the detox.  The tea is mild and not harsh on your system.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you do these easy steps for just three days, you will feel great and, you may even lose a few pounds.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">As you can see, the “</span><span class=\"s5\">3-day detox and rejuvenation plan”</span><span class=\"s1\"> is not hard to do.  Three days will fly by.  YOU CAN DO IT!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Maybe, you’ll want to continue to eat like this forever?  If not, then try and do this three-day detox and rejuvenation every six

Don’t forget one for your body too.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Vitamin C Serum is used to brighten and even out your complexion.  It’s also used as an antioxidant and as a barrier for pollutants, etc.  It works amazing!  I<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JjpV1j\"> use Vitamin C 20% Serum + Ferulic Acid &amp; Hyaluronic Acid for maximum Anti-Aging!</a> 100% Safe &amp; Effective!  It’s a highly concentrated solution to Repair, Protect, &amp; Prevent Skin Aging. No Parabens or oils!  Stimulates Collagen and neutralizes Free Radicals, 1 oz / 30 ml from Cosmetic Skin Solutions LLC.  I get it online at Amazon for about $39.00.  I used to use one that cost $150 that didn’t even come close to this one.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s really important to use an under eye moisturizer that is specifically for eyes.  Honestly, just go to your local CVS or Walgreens and look for one that is for the eyes.  It makes a huge difference.  Make sure to use it twice a day and watch how great your eyes look!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It doesn’t matter what brand of moisturizer you use so long as you use it. Even if you think you can’t because you have oily skin, chances are you need it.  Get the one that is for your skin type.  I use Regenerist by Oil of Olay.  I have used ones that cost hundreds of dollars</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">and I always go back to Oil of Olay because it works.  Just use it daily.  With today’s technology, they’re all good.  No need to be duped into paying a ton of money for ingredients that we can’t even pronounce.  There are some exceptions like stem cell technology and peptides but to start, just chose one and be consistent.  Then move on if you want to spend a bit more on things like <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JoO7CD\">Neova</a>, </span></p>\n<div class=\"a-column a-span3\">\n<div class=\"a-section a-text-left visualRpdColumnSmall firstColumn\">\n<div class=\"a-fixed-left-grid\">\n<div class=\"a-fixed-left-grid-inner\">\n<div class=\"a-fixed-left-grid-col a-col-right\"><span class=\"a-size-small a-color-base visualRpdText\">&#8220;A restoring overnight treatment that targets damage for renewal during the restorative hours of sleep, optimizes moisture retention and relieves visible photoaging signs of aging.&#8221; Relieves visible signs of photoaging for renewal during sleep while optimizing moisture retention.  This is what I use now and I love it!</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a-column a-span3\">\n<div class=\"a-section a-text-left visualRpdColumnSmall unspecifiedColumn\">\n<hr class=\"a-divider-normal visualRpdDivider\" />\n<div class=\"a-fixed-left-grid\">\n<div class=\"a-fixed-left-grid-inner\">\n<div class=\"a-fixed-left-grid-col visualRpdIconSection a-col-left\"></div>\n<div class=\"a-fixed-left-grid-col a-col-right\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Many women want to use more natural products with fewer chemicals and by all means, do so.  Just use them consistently!  I like natural anit-aging products like <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LlJbvz\">Eminence Organic Skincare Monoi Age Corrective Night Cream, 2 Ounce</a></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eminenstore.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3JrWydq62wIVgzaBCh2rHwYZEAAYASAAEgJjvvD_BwE\">Eminence Organic products</a> are both amazing and really work well.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The above products should last you four weeks (probably longer).  If you add them together, the cost is about $10.00 a week.  It’s important that you use enough of the product too.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s5\">#2.  Not using Retin-A or an Alternative Retinoid and, not doing Skin Peels to  Create Collagen.</span></strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\"><i>Retin-A</i></span><span class=\"s1\"> is the only thing you will need a doctor’s prescription for and your regular doctor can give it to you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Here’s the kicker!  Usually, insurance won’t cover Retin-A because it’s considered cosmetic and a tube can run about $250.00 but, do what I do and go online to CanadaPharmacy.com and order it there.  You’ll create an account, fax your script and, they will ship it for about $60.00!  How’s that for saving some money?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Retin-A is so good and it will change your face, neck, and chest, like nothing you’ve ever used before.  I could go on and rave about it but here’s the definition online:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“Retin-A (tretinoin) is a form of vitamin A that helps the skin renew itself.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Shall I say more?  I’ve used it for about ten years!  Just talk to your doctor or NP and then get it as fast as you can.  Start off with the lowest strength and move up.  There are alternatives on the market but I think Retin-A is the best (generic too).  You can get it cheaper on <a href=\"http://www.goodrx.com/\">GoodRx.com</a>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Keep exfoliating and turning over those skin cells! KEY, KEY, KEY to younger skin!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I do an at-home </span><span class=\"s5\">skin peel</span><span class=\"s1\"> two times a month.  Go online and talk to the people at skin-peel.com and they will guide you on what peel is right for you.  It’s literally hundreds if not thousands of dollars that you’ll save by doing them yourself.   Face peels literally only take less than five minutes to do and the results are amazing.  Peels are the second most valuable game changer in my regime, next to Retin-A.  Just two times a month!  How easy is that?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">PLEASE, PLEASE!  ALWAYS WEAR SUNSCREEN WHEN USING THESE PRODUCTS.  After all you’re creating new skin!  It’s like a baby’s.  Protect it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s5\">#3.  Not Eating a lot of Vegetables and Plant Foods throughout the day, Every day! </span></strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you don’t think that a mostly plant-based eating plan will change the way you look (and feel for that matter), then I dare you to try it for 90 days!  I’m not saying don’t eat meat if you’re a meat eater (don’t worry) however, try to eat about 80% to 90% vegetables and nuts throughout the day.  Notice how I didn’t say fruit?  Eat fruit sparingly because it has a lot of sugar with the exception of berries, etc.  Follow this and your skin and body will drastically change.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s5\">#4.   Not Supplementing Correctly and Consistently.</span></strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Supplementing is an excellent way to get you looking and feeling your best.  You don’t need to take loads of them or spend a lot.  Of course, as always, check with your medical professional before beginning any supplement program.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Your skin reflects how healthy you are in the inside so it makes sense to supplement your inside with the nutrients that balance and maintain your body, therefore creating a great body and a younger looking appearance.  Not to mention all of the health benefits too!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>What supplements and/or vitamins do you need to be healthy and have great skin?</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Vitamins C, D, E, K,  B complex, CoQ10 (Ubiquinol), Omega-</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">3’s, and probiotics.</span></p>\n<p>Ideally, you want to get your vitamins and nutrients from food.  If you want to skip the supplements, try and do a smoothie twice a day.  Here is the recipe that I absolutely love!  Feel free to add nutrients, etc. (beets would be awesome).  Just keep the fruit content down for calorie content.</p>\n<p>My anti-cancer and super antioxidant smoothie recipe:</p>\n<p>1. Fill blender 75% with organic kale.</p>\n<p>2. Add one cup of unsweetened almond milk.</p>\n<p>3. Add a handful of frozen organic blueberries.</p>\n<p>4. Add a handful of frozen organic blackberries or raspberries.</p>\n<p>5. Add cinnamon (about a half teaspoon).</p>\n<p>6. Add turmeric (about a half teaspoon).</p>\n<p>7. Add ginger (about a half teaspoon).</p>\n<p>8. I also add two probiotics (I open the capsules and add the powder in). **Optional</p>\n<p>9. I add in a half of teaspoon of coconut oil. **Optional</p>\n<p>10.One-quarter banana for a nice tasty texture.</p>\n<p>11. Add a little water and or ice. **Optional</p>\n<p><strong>BLEND!  This will create two green smoothies that not only has changed how I look and feel but, has helped to reduce my husband’s diabetic symptoms. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>The is what I call my anti-cancer and super antioxidant part of my smoothie recipe is the Turmeric. Turmeric is known for its anti-inflammatory properties.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Here’s the Supplement Breakdown:</span></strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Vitamins C and E</i> help by reducing the damage caused by free radicals. <i>Vitamin A</i> is needed especially if your skin is dry and flaky but you usually get this well enough through food such as fruits and veggies.  <i>A good multivitamin should have enough A and E in addition to a good diet. (Please consult your doctor before taking A and E by themselves)</i></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“ Vitamin B Complex.</i> When it comes to skin, the single most important B vitamin is biotin, a nutrient that forms the basis of skin, nail, and hair cells. Without adequate amounts, you may end up with dermatitis (an itchy, scaly skin reaction) or sometimes even hair loss. Even a mild deficiency causes symptoms.” (webmd.com)</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA)</i> is a very powerful antioxidant. In fact, it’s way more potent than vitamin C or E.  Alpha-Lipoic Acid may turn out to be a super boost for aging skin. What makes it so special, skin experts say is, its ability to penetrate both oil and water, affecting skin cells from both the inside and the outside of the body. Most other antioxidants can do one but not both.” (webmd.com).  I take one twice a day and I can see a secondary effect and that is, I’ve dropped five pounds without trying and my skin is much more radiant.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Maybe your doctor has told you to take <i>fish oil or flaxseed oil</i>? If not you should!  In fish oil, the omega-3 fatty acid serves as a skin barrier and also helps to maintain inflammation.  It also supports mental health, promotes cognitive agility and decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and heart attacks.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Ubiquinol Coenzyme Q10</i> is great as it protects your skin from oxidative stress and helps your skin repair itself. The Co means together and enzymes are the catalyst for all chemical reactions in our bodies.  With this, we couldn’t sustain life!  The problem is, as we get older, we make less and less of it.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Just eat your green leafy veggies to get your daily <i>Vitamin K</i>. It’s also in your multi-vitamin too.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">“<i>Vitamin D</i> deficiency has now been linked to breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, depression, weight gain, and other maladies. These studies show that people with higher levels of vitamin D have a lower risk of disease, although they do not definitively prove that lack of vitamin D causes disease — or that vitamin D supplements would lower risk.” (WebMD/com).  Just get your levels checked to see if you need it.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">There has been a lot of mixed data about taking a daily <i>multi-vitamin</i> meaning, some are saying that a daily vitamin is useless. However, until they can actually prove otherwise, enhancing your diet with nutritional supplements can get you closer to optimal health.  One of the reasons we may need a daily vitamin is because our soil is not producing as much nutrient-rich food.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s said that most if not all disease start in the gut! <i>Probiotics</i> provide lots of benefits for your immune system. “When probiotics are abundant in your body, it’s harder for bacteria that cause illness to get a foothold.” (doctoroz.com)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">For all of my supplements, I go to Whole Foods and use their brands.  They are very inexpensive and most are plant-based.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have the ability to, get a blood test to see if and what you may be deficient in.  I was surprised that I needed iron.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>DISCLAIMER</i>:  I am in not a doctor or healthcare worker.  I am not recommending any supplement program.  I am only sharing what has worked for me and what I have researched personally.  Please consult your physician.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s5\">#5.  Not Lifting Weights and Losing Muscle Tone.</span></strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">To me, there are two great things about exercising and the first is, when it’s over!! And the second is how my clothes fit.  No, I won’t work out like an athlete or look like I’m eighteen again but, I can look tone and so can you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Lifting weights will change your life.  If you have never or you don’t know how just get started with what you can lift and move up the weight size.  Do one body part per day.  If it’s too much, then break it up by two times a day for fifteen minutes each, five days a week.  Many women think they will bulk up, and I have to say that “I wish” however, women don’t have that kind of testosterone.  As we age, we lose muscle every decade.  We can lift all day and still not bulk up so, lift away and watch the shape of your body change.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You’ll see amazing changes if you are consistent.  Use videos, fitness magazines, Pinterest, Apps, etc.  Just try it and in three months or so, you’ll see a difference in your shape.  Plus, it’s good for your bones as you age.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Quick Recap:  As directed by the product manufacturer and consistently:</span></p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Wear Sunscreen, Vitamin C Serum, Eye Cream, and Moisturizer.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Use Retin-A and do Skin Peels.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Eat Lots of Veggies, Nuts, and Seeds.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Lift Weights.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p19\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p26\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">The 5 Steps to Look As Young As You Feel</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What are the 5 Steps to Look As Young As You Feel?  When it comes down to it, we can spend a lot of time, money and energy trying to stay healthy but really, it comes down to these five things!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">At 20 years old I weighed 115 pounds, at 49 years old I weighed 145.  I was well on my way to some serious health problems.  Thankfully, I used this solution (The 5 Steps to look as young as you feel)  and I’m back in the 120’s and turning 50!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">My skin has never looked better and, I have so much energy that seriously, I hate to go to bed at night! In fact, my energy has gotten so much better, I go to bed at eleven and pop up at five a.m. and here I am, hoping that the day doesn’t go by too fast.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When you have an abundance of good healthy energy, you have the energy to do so much and the only bad thing is that there really isn’t enough time in the day to do everything that you want!  I use every second of my time to do the things I want to and still, I have so many more dreams and aspirations.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When you feel this kind of energy, you’ll know exactly what I mean.  I want that for you too.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">With “The 5 Steps to Look As Young As You Feel” it’s a simple and quick five-step plan that doesn’t take more than an hour or so of your day.  And, for those of you that think you don’t have an hour for yourself (Hmmm?) then, you can break it up into four, fifteen minutes sessions or any other time combinations.  Just so long as you do the steps.  They’re super easy, I assure you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I promise if you do these five steps, you will “Look and Feel Younger” in no time. If I were asking you to pay for the plan, I could say something like “I guarantee it!” But, it’s totally free because I want to share the easy stuff that makes a difference.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There is no need to feel like you can’t look and feel young.  Today, we are living into our eighties and nineties and hell, pretty soon it’s predicted that we will live way past one-hundred.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The great thing is, with technology, we can still look and feel really great.  But also with technology, keeping us alive longer, it’s up to us to do the things necessary to stay healthy and young.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We all know what direction the healthcare industry is heading and that’s down a bad road. Even if you have health insurance, it doesn’t cover much anymore.  The best way to stay out of the doctor&#8217;s office is to do these five steps.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The thing is that we have to actively pursue prevention methods.  Prevention of disease, the sun, food that causes disease and, we have to move our bodies.</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 class=\"p63\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">How to get rid of the wrinkles at home like a doctors office!</span></h2>\n<h2 class=\"p64\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><b>How to get rid of rough texture on your face</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p65\"><strong><span class=\"s5\">This is how I smooth out my skin.</span></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Morning:</span></h3>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Cleanse my face.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Use a daily, morning swipe of Glycolic 10% daily exfoliate ( it will make your cheeks pink and shine through your makeup.

It only takes a few minutes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The next day or so, your skin will peel a little or flake.  Viola! This is the old texture and new skin coming through.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Do this every two weeks to see good results.  Keep your new skin covered with sunscreen and keep using your Retin-A.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Using Retin-A, peels, and, sunscreen will work in synergy to give you that beautiful baby skin!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p68\"><span class=\"s1\">Look Younger For Less Money!</span><span class=\"s13\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Basic cosmetic procedures that are the least expensive and would be a natural progression after skin care. Compared to products, cosmetic procedures are not a commodity so finding bargain cosmetic procedures may not be a good thing.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We’re talking about wounding the skin, and this doesn’t necessarily correlate with cheaper. However, there is no reason you can’t call around to your local dermatologists or plastic surgeons to find out what the procedures cost.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Then you can compare for yourself. I pick three or four good doctors or medical spas in my area and check their prices, and then I get on their email list. Before long, I get discounted offers of up to thirty percent off their procedures.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s worth it to compare and get on their lists. You’ll get weekly emails from all the places you signed up at to compare the prices. You can even call your favorite doctor or spa and ask if they will match prices. They do it all the time!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Botox</i> – You should get Botox as a prevention measure. You may only need ten units or so just to prevent frown lines or lines that may be forming between your nose and eyes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You can also have Botox used on your crow’s feet (the lines around your eyes). This helps tremendously. If you need thirty or forty units and you can’t afford it all at once, then get ten units every few weeks until you get all areas covered.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost varies, but I have paid up to fourteen-dollars a unit. When I got on the doctors’ or Spa lists, I received discounts and now I only pay about nine to ten dollars per unit. That’s a pretty good savings. Some doctors will have a buy two get one free promotion.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Also, there are competing products to Botox. Because they’re competing with Botox, they may be less money. Botox, which is owned by Allergen, has a loyalty program, as well. I recently received a coupon for $100 off the total cost of my Botox!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This program is called BRILLIANT DISTINCTIONS. Make sure you sign up or have your doctor/injector sign you up and every time you get Botox or another Allergan product such as Juvederm, etc. you will receive points towards your next service.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I almost got my most recent Botox for free!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Chemical Peel</i> – A chemical peel is great for removing the surface layer of the skin. The process wounds the skin, which causes it to heal itself by creating new collagen. A chemical peel has different strengths so the cost will vary.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">In most states, a chemical peel will cost about $150 to  $200 in a doctor’s office. You’ll want to continue having peels, as they will help create beautiful skin with less texture and, diminish fine lines.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You can do them yourself, but start with a low strength.  Unfortunately, in my learning process, I bought a thirty-percent TCA peel online (I should not have been able to purchase this strength peel without a license), and I did some serious damage to my skin. Damage so bad that, I have to hide the scars every day of my life. It’s not the worth the risk to try and skip ahead rather than to start slow or let a professional do it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you want to do your own peel, start with a small patch of skin to see how it will react. I do my own peels every two to four weeks, usually no more than twice a month. You can go to <i>skin-peel.com</i> to find them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>The secret to making peels comfortable is while they are on your face, use your blow dryer on the cool setting or, use a small hand fan pointed at your face. It makes a difference.</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Retin-A</i> – A prescription is required, but Retin-A is fantastic!! “Retin-A (tretinoin) is a topical preparation of vitamin A, which has antioxidant properties, just like the vitamin by itself. It’s an acid derivative of retinol (vitamin A).  If you don&#8217;t want to get a prescription then you can now get a good one over the counter called <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2MiKxZs\"><strong>Differin Gel </strong></a>sold at most stores.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The important aspect is really the effectiveness of what Retin-A does. Studies have shown that Retin-A can help reduce wrinkles, reduce acne, exfoliate dead skin cells and redistribute melanin. Melanin redistribution results in lighter, more even skin color. Thus Retin-A is often used to treat skin discolorations caused by excessive sun exposure.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have sensitive skin, it may not work for you, it may be too harsh, but there are alternatives with lesser concentrations.  I would still try to mix a little every other night in my favorite cream. Just don’t give up. This stuff is amazing!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Teeth Whitening</i> – This makes a huge difference. You could have perfect skin and straight teeth, but if your teeth are stained and dull, no one will notice. If you have bright, white teeth, you’ll look better, and younger, and feel better too.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost in my state is about $50.00, which is down from $500 when I first had it done. There are many good ones over the counter too.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">IPL-, which stands for intense pulse light or flash lamp therapy, is a noninvasive and non-ablative treatment that uses high intensity pulses of visible light to improve the appearance of birthmarks, port wine stains, broken facial veins, rosy cheeks, rosacea, red thread veins of the legs, freckles, age spots, facial lines and wrinkles, and the removal of unwanted dark hair. The procedure is referred to as photo rejuvenation and requires a series of treatments.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost nationally runs about $300 to $400. You should only need a few treatments. I have seen it as low as $150 per treatment if you agree to three or more.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Just a quick note: I have been using a product called Black Magic Tattoo remover (it’s a small handheld pulse light machine) to remove a lot of my brown spots on my arms and legs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It works the same as an IPL machine.  I got it on Amazon.com however, it takes time.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I wouldn’t use the machine on my face though. It’s important to know that brown spots on the body are very hard to remove. The light process takes time. I also add a skin bleach and put a little of my skin peel on each spot too when I do peels on my face.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Dermapen or Micro-Needling – “ Sterile surgical stainless micro-needles pierce the skin leading to apoptosis of cells in the dermis.” “What is Apoptosis? Apoptosis or programmed cell death is when a cell essentially commits suicide. This process is natural, controlled and routine. Little inflammation is caused.” “The Dermapen uses eleven, 33-gauge microneedles to stimulate the dermis. Needles vertically pierce the skin to enhance rejuvenation results. Small holes are punctured at a rate of 1000/second. </span><span class=\"s2\">This proliferation of the body’s tissue continues to release growth factors from fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and monocytes.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Note: I have had <i>Dermapen</i> about six times and it works wonders. It’s comparable to lasers like Fraxel but without all the downtime and expense. Many doctors will give you a discount if you buy a package of four or more. You can save hundreds by doing this. I paid $150 per treatment vs. $300 – $350 by buying the package.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Juvederm</i> – Juvederm is an injectable filler consisting mostly of hyaluronic acid. It’s used to fill in areas to smooth out wrinkles and deep folds on the face and can last up to a year. You can pay anywhere from $400 a syringe to $800. I pay only about $400 – $450 depending on the specials the doctors have. Currently, my doctor has a buy one get one free, and I can save the second one for a later time. At first, you may need two but, as your own stem cells work, you will need less later.  In my case, it lasts about six months.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">These are certainly not all of the basic cosmetic procedures available, but these tend to be the least expensive and the least invasive. These procedures really do well with regard to anti-aging and reversing past damage.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">They’re also a good alternative to going under the knife. I think one day these products and procedures will be affordable for all of us.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">With today’s technology, the need for doctors to perform invasive procedures will diminish so they’ll be more eager to lower procedure costs to attract more patients. My hope is that you get the best skin possible without having to figure out where you will get the money.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Let’s face it, many of us want to take care of ourselves but, products and procedures can be a little expensive.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Hormones and Aging Skin</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7622\" style=\"width: 401px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7622\" class=\"wp-image-7622\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10684352_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"391\" height=\"274\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10684352_s-400x280-300x210.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10684352_s-400x280.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7622\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hormones at middle age</p></div>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Hormones help prevent skin from aging. We have all seen it, or maybe we have been troubled by the changes we’re seeing in our own skin. Thin skin, sagging, dullness, lines, and wrinkles (sorry, I had to remind you).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, it happens to everyone at some time. For many of us, we want to look as young as we feel, however, sometimes the outside is not so accommodating to the inside. As we age, especially starting in our thirties and forties, our hormones begin to decline and then diminish over time.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Because of this, our skin becomes fragile, thin, wrinkled and, sags. If you have gone through menopause then you should know that it’s been stated that, we will lose thirty percent of our skin’s collagen in the first five years after menopause! Ouch! You can counter this effect! We can use oral hormones or hormone creams (prescribed by a doctor) to increase collagen support.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I personally am not one for taking synthetic hormones, as I believe there is an increased risk of breast cancer and other harmful effects. I use a bioidentical hormone cream prescribed by my doctor.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Does it help my skin? I like to think so. For me, it’s been an accumulative effect of bio-identical hormones, peels, topical retinoid, vitamin C serums, sunscreen, supplements, exercising and a semi-clean diet that keeps me and my skin balanced.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s important to have your hormones tested routinely, as you want to keep your hormones balanced. I was skeptical at first going on a bio-identical hormone treatment, as I thought if I did, I’d get cancer. Because of reading and hearing that hormones cause cancer (in the wrong context), I fought taking them! Eventually, I opened up my mind and learned just the opposite.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Note: All hormone replacement therapy has some cancer risks. However, if monitored, these can be minimized.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">According to many doctors and research, balancing our hormones keeps us from getting cancer instead of the reverse. In fact, it’s having very little hormones that may cause cancer in the first place or, at least can contribute to it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">As I said, I personally would not take oral hormones, but that’s just me and you have to make an educated decision based on what is right for you. At the very least, it’s good to see where your levels are. Okay, back to my point. When you let your hormones fluctuate, it can have a negative impact on your skin. The bottom line is to get your hormones tested and get them balanced, if even just for a better quality of health.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">The 4 Crucial Anti-Aging Hormones</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I wrote a post about natural hormone replacement.  I wrote specifically about the four hormones that are crucial to anti-aging.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">These are, DHEA, Melatonin,  Sex Hormones such as Estrogen, Progesterone, Testosterone and, Thyroid.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Some scientists believe that if we restore these hormones to pre-decline levels, we can reverse the aging process.  They may even prime us for extra decades of life.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Each of the above hormones does a specific job.  DHEA is profound because it’s the hormone that has the most influence on the aging process.  It alone could actually extend our lifespan.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Melatonin manages the body’s sleep and awake cycle and, scavenges free radicals.  Which in turn, reduces oxidative stress in our body which then, reduces degenerative disease like cancer.  It’s also the body’s time clock or aging clock.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Natural estrogen and progesterone combined, help us women ease through menopause.  They also perform as a safeguard for women’s health after menopause.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Testosterone replacement can help both men and women with low libido, protect against heart disease (although this is being debated right now), fight osteoporosis (even in men too), increase lean muscle mass, may reverse age-related fat accumulation and, other age-related diseases.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Thyroid affects tens of millions of people.  Millions have a thyroid issue and don’t even know it.  Symptoms vary from low energy, difficulty losing weight, low immune system, anemia, heart problems, hair loss, brittle nails, depression, and the list goes on.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I have been on thyroid medication for two years and just recently, I decided I didn’t need it anymore.  Ten days later, I was feeling great until I dropped a fork while putting the dishes away and cried my eyes out.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">For the next two days, I felt down and I knew something was wrong. That’s just not me.  The only thing that had changed was me thinking I didn’t need my thyroid therapy.  When I got back on it, my mood was back to my happy self again.  Placebo?  I don’t think so.  I need thyroid medicine whether I like it or not.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, you will need a blood test to determine what your hormone levels are.  It’s almost certain that, if you are in middle-age and beyond, you will need to balance your hormones.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s true that medical experts disagree about the significance of a Testosterone decline, and whether the health benefits of HRT outweigh the risks.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">HRT (hormone replacement therapy) is something you will have to carefully consider for yourself and whether it’s right for you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you decide to do HRT, please be careful to work with your doctor and not with some unknown source on the internet.  It only takes the smallest amount of hormones to be effective, conversely, the same is true for damage to be done too.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Lastly, if you do HRT, try and do natural hormones.  I do bio-identical which are made by a Compound Pharmacist.  It’s important to know that, just because it’s a natural hormone doesn’t mean that it’s without risk.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Here’s a little side note that my doctor told me.  When I was worried about taking hormones because of a breast cancer risk or any cancer risk whatsoever, she said “Theresa, you have more of a risk for cancer by not balancing your hormones.”  I’m putting my faith in my doctor and in my research.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It makes sense because the longer we live the more exposure we have to the things that cause cancer right? So, if we keep our hormones balanced (they make the biggest decisions for our body) then wouldn’t it be true that without them, we have less of a fighting chance.</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h1 class=\"p69\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Do you have a thyroid problem?</span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7393\" style=\"width: 384px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7393\" class=\"wp-image-7393\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/thyroidpic.jpg\" alt=\"do you have thyroid disease\" width=\"374\" height=\"249\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7393\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">At home thyroid test</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"p69\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">At home test below:</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">It’s believed by many doctors that our basal metabolic temperature or BMT is the most accurate measure of thyroid function.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">We can check our own BMT at home by using an oral thermometer.  Not a digital one.</span></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">This is how you do it:</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><em>Note:  Please do not use this as medical advice.  Please see your doctor for a proper diagnosis.</em></p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">When you are ready to go to bed, shake an oral thermometer down and put it next to your bed where you can easily reach it in the morning. Don’t shake it down in the morning because this can raise your body temperature and the test won’t be accurate.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">When you wake up in the morning, put the thermometer in your armpit and leave it there for 10 minutes. Try and lie as still as you can.  Don’t get up or move as this too will increase your metabolic rate thus, raising your temperature.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">After the 10 minutes are up, record your temperature.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Repeat this process for 3 – 5 days (at least 3 but preferably 5).</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If your BMT consistently falls below 97.8 F, you may have an underactive thyroid.  BMT Normally ranges from 97.8 F to 98.2 F.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">**If you have any kind of infection wait to take the test.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you fall below and you have some of the symptoms below, it may be time to see your doctor for a blood test.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Symptoms of Hypothyroidism</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Fatigue</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Weakness</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Weight gain or increased difficulty losing weight</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Coarse, dry hair</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Dry, rough pale skin</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Hair loss</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Cold intolerance (you can’t tolerate cold temperatures like those around you)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Muscle cramps and frequent muscle aches</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Constipation</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Depression</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Irritability</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Memory loss</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Abnormal menstrual cycles</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Decreased libido</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the body lacks sufficient thyroid hormone. Since the main purpose of thyroid hormone is to “run the body’s metabolism,” it is understandable that people with this condition will have symptoms associated with a slow metabolism. The estimates vary, but approximately 10 million Americans have this common medical condition. In fact, as many as 10% of women may have some degree of thyroid hormone deficiency.   Hypothyroidism is more common than you would believe, and millions of people are currently hypothyroid and don’t know it.”</span></p>\n<p>Again.  This is only a test and not a proper diagnosis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p20\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<h1 class=\"p10\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Why you should supplement your diet</span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7432\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7432\" class=\"wp-image-7432 size-medium\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/20959515_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"Supplement your diet\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/20959515_s-400x280-300x210.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/20959515_s-400x280.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7432\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Why you should supplement your diet</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I eat pretty clean.  Lot’s of veggies and I don’t consume a lot of animal products.  I wouldn’t think that I need to add supplements to my diet.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Maybe a more valid point would be, if mother nature intended for me to have the right vitamins and minerals, they would already be included in the foods that I eat.  Especially when I eat a wide variety as it is.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The truth is, you should add supplements to your diet if you want to fight disease and have a longer lifespan.  Diet alone can’t do this.  With supplements, we get the extra boost needed to have a better quality of life.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Put in another way, I once read that “supplements are to humans what fertilizer is to plants.”  That statement makes sense, doesn’t it?  So the question is, water, sunlight and grow? Or, water, sunlight, fertilizer and thrive?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">So, a good diet does the body good.  A good diet with supplements makes the body thrive!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If supplements are so important, how did our ancestors survive without supplements?  If you look back, most didn’t live that long.  Sure, even if we don’t supplement and we have a poor diet, genetically, we can survive into our 40’s and 50’s.  However, if we eat an optimum diet with supplementation, we may be able to live until we are 100 years old!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I don’t want to live to be whatever age if I don’t have a good quality of life. I’ve been to nursing homes plenty of times and it was heartbreaking to see people sitting in wheelchairs all lined up against the wall.  To me, I felt like they were just stuck there until it was time to die.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I know we are all going to get old and we’re all going to die but, it’s the way that we’re going to do it that is important.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s important that you don’t just start taking random supplements because some can have adverse effects on your health like taking iron if you don’t need it, etc.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I would advise that you talk to a professional.  Maybe a nutritionist.  I’m not sure if doctors know about nutrition these days as they are probably overloaded as it is trying to keep up with our general healthcare requirements.  You will also need a blood test.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I have created a “<i>Better Health/Anti-Aging Supplement Guide</i>” that I use and I swear by. You can download it from the link below.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I’m not some fanatic meaning, I don’t believe that we have to take handfuls of supplements.  We just need some basic ones and I’ve put the link below if you want to check them out.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">As always though, please check with your doctor before starting a supplement program because they also can interfere with medication.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">So the take away here is eating a variety of nutritious foods, cut out the saturated fat and sugar, and supplement your diet for a healthier and longer life.</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">How to handle a changing appearance</span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7319\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7319\" class=\"wp-image-7319\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20081488_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"390\" height=\"273\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20081488_s-400x280-300x210.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20081488_s-400x280.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7319\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How to handle fading looks</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The truth is, in middle age, if we don’t begin to find peace while aging, we better get a grip on it now! If you were always a stunning beauty, then you had fifty or more years of outside aesthetics, but know this is not your power.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Your power now has to come from within. If God wills and you take care of yourself, you will hopefully have at least another thirty or forty years to live your truth within. This is when the real living begins.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This will be your new power, which has nothing to do with what’s on the outside. You can’t control that anymore. Maybe this is what we are really afraid of. In middle age, it’s hard to control anything anymore, especially our looks and our bodies.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Just try to maintain your health and remain positive, and the rest will take care of itself. How can you find your new you? Start by being kind and gentle with yourself, just like you would for a friend who came to you for advice about the fears of aging. You would never be as harsh to a friend as you are to yourself. Be your own best friend. It makes a difference.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you want to find out what great qualities you have other than your looks, ask your partner, your friends, and your kids about how you may have touched their lives in a positive way.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Listen to all the wonderful stories they will tell you about you. They will tell you things that will touch your heart and make you proud of who you are. Notice when they tell you about you, they never tell you about how good you looked, only about how wonderful you are or how unselfish you may be and, how much you are loved by everyone.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s a great freedom to let go of the fear of aging. Once you do this, and you really accept it, a great peace will come over you. You no longer have to spend wasted time on ways to stay and look younger.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You will no longer waste time comparing yourself to the younger generation or spending money on things just to keep up with the outside world. Just think about how much extra money and time you will have when you let go and age with kindness toward yourself.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You can now travel and do whatever you want. You are still you only better. Remember there is nothing broken about us because we have aged. We don’t have to fix our face or change our bodies for anyone, only unless we want to for us.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Should you choose to do anything to yourself, do it because it will make you feel better and because of you and only you want to do it. Don’t let your partner talk you into or out of whatever makes you feel happy about yourself.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You will never fool Mother Nature, nor will you outrun aging, but if it makes you feel better than do it! You will never be here again, so make it count for you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">One day we won’t worry about the wrinkles we have, and what we do or don’t look like, because the real worry will be about our mortality. The point here is to live and not burden ourselves about aging, because we will all age and, one day, what we look like will be the least of our concerns.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Our concerns will then be about how to live each day healthy and free from pain. What used to make us uneasy about aging will hopefully only be an issue that we will have let go of so that we may enjoy the time we have left.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Enjoy the time you have left. Go and do everything you want to do without fear, without judgment, and without guilt.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p19\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<h1 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Do you change the way you look as you age?</span></strong></span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7513\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7513\" class=\"wp-image-7513 size-medium\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/30576356_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"Like the way that you look as you age\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/30576356_s-400x280-300x210.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/30576356_s-400x280.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Do you like the way you look as you age?</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><em><strong><span class=\"s1\">Older women are the most dangerous on the planet. We have nothing to lose!</span></strong></em></span></p>\n<p class=\"p70\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><em><strong><span class=\"s1\">~Jane Fonda</span></strong></em></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Are we happy in the circumstances we are in or have we settled as we have gotten older? </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Let’s face it; aging requires change. We can’t wear those sexy clothes we once wore, or wear the same makeup as when we were sixteen because that would be ridiculous. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">To some, this may seem sad, even like a death sentence, to be forced to make changes that we don’t want to. Unfortunately, and fortunately, we have to make sure we make changes as we age. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Many women don’t change, and they continue to do the same things they always did. Big mistake because you are not the same person you were when you were twenty, thirty, or even five years ago.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Life is moving faster, even when we feel we are slowing down. Look at it like this, you were a teen once and you wore stuff you wouldn’t dream of wearing now. You naturally changed as you went into your twenties. Somewhere along the way, we stopped and got stuck.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> We continue to wear the same things and styles, year after year, decade after decade, without noticing that we need an update or, we do notice, but we nothing about it. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Maybe it’s because we get caught in a time gap. Are we still young, middle age, old or what? How do we perceive ourselves at middle age? At what point or decade do we make the necessary changes that should be made for our forever changing self?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The short answer is to look back at pictures, and if you have looked the same for the last ten, fifteen, twenty years or longer, you need a serious update. Don’t panic, because it’s not hard to do. A little change in your hairstyle, color, makeup and clothes, and you are all set. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I look at magazines for women my age, and I find inspiration through catalogs that cater to women over forty. It has served me well. In fact, I change a little too much. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I change my hair color at least every six months. It’s probably not the best thing to change so often. My son was horrified when he knocked on my bedroom door the other day to ask me a question, and when I opened the door to answer him, he looked shocked and yelled out, “Mom, your hair is blue!” That statement didn’t even faze my daughter, who was sitting at the kitchen table. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">She didn’t even bother to look my way because she knows me so well, and this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that I shock someone with the things I do to myself. It’s just who I am and I happen to like it. By the way, the blue color was accidental. You see I had blonde hair, and one afternoon I decided I might look better with black hair.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p19\"><span class=\"s1\">It was a funny mistake because the tint in the black dye turned my blonde hair blue (sounds like a country song doesn’t it?). I didn’t panic; did I mention it’s not my first time? My son, the tattletale that he is, couldn’t wait to call his dad to inform him that his wife has blue hair. My husband, being a person that doesn’t like change, and who had the lucky draw to be married to a person who does, was yet again, baffled by why I just couldn’t be like everyone else and be, in his words, “normal.” He does admit though, I keep him on his toes because he never knows who he will come home to. I rest my case! Change is a good thing.</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h1 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Where Women Go As We Age</span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Jb6mfy\">https://amzn.to/2Jb6mfy</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8225\" style=\"width: 214px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8225\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8225\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-06-04-at-3.38.17-PM-204x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"204\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-06-04-at-3.38.17-PM-204x300.png 204w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-06-04-at-3.38.17-PM.png 376w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8225\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Jb6mfy\">Where women go. The reality of middle-age</a></p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What are we waiting for? We can’t wait for the future to happen and we certainly can’t live in the past. In middle age and beyond, we have to come to terms with the fact that our choices have changed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">For some, the changes may not be good, for others, aging is a time when we can do the things we have only dreamed of.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I am inspired by Diana Nyad, the first women to ever swim to Florida from Cuba without a cage. This is extremely inspiring because she was a sixty-four-year-old woman!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I am impressed because I know a few sixty-year-olds who believe they can’t park too far away from the grocery store doors because they don’t want to walk that far, let alone, swim for fifty-three hours and one hundred and ten miles.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Did I mention this was her fifth attempt? Just goes to show you that we are never too old and to never stop trying no matter what. She made her first attempt when she was twenty-eight, and then in 2011, she tried three times at the age of sixty-two, and again at sixty-three.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When she finally accomplished the swim on September 2, 2013, she had three messages for us all: one, we should never, ever give up, two, </span><span class=\"s5\">you’re never too old to chase your dreams,</span><span class=\"s1\"> and three, it looks like a solitary sport, but it is a team.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Doesn’t that sum up what we women are going through right now? Never give up on yourself, no matter what age you are. Enjoy your life, love yourself, and do what it is that feeds your soul. It’s never too late to achieve and live your own personal dream. Just have the belief and do away with the fear.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Remember, large or small, your dream belongs to you, and it’s just as important as anyone else’s. We are all living our own dream and we can create a new one if we don’t like the one we are in.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally, you are never alone. It takes a team, meaning your friends, your family, your spouse, and your faith, especially faith in yourself. Whatever it is around you that lifts you and inspires you is what you are meant to be. It is important to always be mindful, moreover, keep an open mind.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You never know when the universe is offering you a gift, and if you are not awake, then you will miss opportunities and the energy will go elsewhere.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Too many times we get up, go to work, come home and then go to bed without taking even one second to appreciate the gift of life and what it has to offer us. For those of us who ask why are we here? The quick answer is to take a look around and embrace the gift of life.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The experience of being born may be the only reason we are here. We don’t need to create chaos trying to make a bigger meaning than necessary, otherwise, we waste the time we have. Sure it’s great if you are able to leave a legacy, but even if you don’t, its okay too.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The only wasted life is a life not lived fully. What does fully mean to you? If we embrace the experience of life without thinking there is an attachment, then we are living a life that is meant to be and, therefore, we receive the blessings that come with it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The one day I will get there is now, and it’s a fork, and you must take the right path that makes you happy.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Our culture teaches us that we won’t ever get there; therefore, we are in a constant state of searching and wondering what’s next. I hope you realize your unique beauty and find the energy within right now, this moment. Every second counts.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This day too will pass and you will never get it back. Whatever holds you back now, you will look back in three or four years and realize how fantastic you really were. You will question why you stayed in certain states of mind, relationships, jobs or whatever held you back in the past.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">As we get older, we tend to think we are more tired, especially women, because we are still thinking we can do it all. There are two kinds of energy. One is when you are tired and don’t feel like doing anything. You may feel a bit down on yourself; you decide you don’t have any energy to engage in life.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This energy level is the one when you haven’t slept or you need to eat, so you do and you get your energy back. The second energy level is when you have slept, eaten and still, you have no energy to enjoy life or to engage with others. Perhaps dare I say the word depressed? If you ate more or slept more, you would not find your energy in this state.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">However, if suddenly your lottery ticket won or your soul mate came into your life in an instant, you would find your energy! This is the kind of energy you should strive to tap into. Wake up as though you have won the lottery of life, and you love yourself enough, more than anyone else could ever. You have the energy to live with excitement, just remove the negativity that is draining it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We need to live in real moments in time. There is a book called <i>Real Moments</i> by Barbara De Angelis. If you take your life and your minutes for granted, then you should read this book. It will not only show you how to feel the sun on your face and the wind in your hair, it will show you how to live like you should before you die and actually feel like you live in the moment.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I know this may sound like a circular question, but there is a difference between going through the motions and living in the moment. When you actually live in the moment, time seems to stand still and you feel every experience and sensation happening in that moment. You owe it to yourself to live this way.</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h1 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><i>MAKING PEACE WITH AGING</i></span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7517\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7517\" class=\"wp-image-7517 size-medium\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/21783809_l1-400x280-1-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"making peace with aging\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/21783809_l1-400x280-1-300x210.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/21783809_l1-400x280-1.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7517\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Making peace with aging</p></div>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i> </i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Making peace with aging, Hmmm? How does a woman make peace with aging in a culture obsessed with youth?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It doesn’t matter what age we are, the issue may change but the focus on aging remains the same. And that focus is how to keep a youthful appearance, stay healthy and remain active.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s great for an aging woman to center around taking care of herself, but it’s another matter to obsess about getting old, and, yet, at some point we all do it. I guess you could say I’m lucky because my appearance was never stunning, but I felt beautiful anyways.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I can age graciously by making peace with aging because I was, and still am, an ordinary woman, and that’s okay. It’s the beautiful women I feel for because they seem to be the people having the hardest time with aging.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I really believe when you are ordinary looking like myself, you age more lovely than when you have already reached your peak. However, all women get to the same place eventually, and there is no escaping it. But beauty is all relative anyway.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Sure, I look back at pictures and see my taught skin, my shapely body, my vibrant eyes and the youth that I didn’t appreciate, and I am reminded again how fast life really goes by. With this reminder, I gain a moment of happiness because I also realize I am healthy, happy and look relatively good for my age.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I know life could be worse, so I don’t dwell on the past or question what God has given me. It won’t change where I am today or where I will be tomorrow. It would be wise to make peace with aging sooner than later just in case there is a little more work to do down the road.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Life is a creation in progress, and it shouldn’t be that we are looking and waiting for the end, because that could come for anyone on any day. As we all know, there are no guarantees that we will have another day beyond this one.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I have heard it said that, if you don’t feel old by the time you hit fifty, you soon will. If we live long enough, half of our lives will be spent as older women. I have never thought about it like this before. When I was young, I said I wanted to live forever!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, I just want to live a good life and be happy while I am here. I don’t think the answer to getting old is lying about our age, either. Some women add a few years to their age when asked so that others might say they look good for their age.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p19\"><span class=\"s1\">How can this make us feel good because we, if no one else, still know how old we really are? Don’t fall into the trap of being afraid to tell your age. Just making it another year is a miracle at any age, young or old</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Free yourself to let grow old compassionately</span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7525\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7525\" class=\"wp-image-7525 size-medium\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meandbrandi-2-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"Grow old with compassion for yourself\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meandbrandi-2-400x280-300x210.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meandbrandi-2-400x280.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7525\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grow old with compassion for yourself</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Call it growing old, getting old, aging, or whatever you want to call the inevitable. Getting old is going to happen no matter what. As we move towards the later years and age, there is something we still have yet to do and that is to forgive.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Forgive ourselves and forgive others, to let go and free ourselves to grow old with compassion for ourselves. Maybe we could have been better wives, mothers, sisters, givers, or whatever you may have regrets about, so what, the past is the past and it no longer matters anymore.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What’s done is done, now it’s about being kind to yourself. If you need to let others know what you now realize, then let them know and ask for forgiveness, forgive them if you need to and move on.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Whatever we have been searching for outside of ourselves is already within us. There is nothing to find out there that we don’t already have inside. I talk to or hear about many older people that are deeply sad about the past. Maybe its things they wished they had done or wished they hadn’t done.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are holding in sadness, despair, regret or any other emotion that you may be attributing to unhappiness, then just let it go. If you can do something about it, do it now and do it quickly, but don’t dwell on it. Whatever the past was, it doesn’t equal the future and the future is now. There is no reason not to forgive ourselves for whatever mistakes we have made in the past even if they were made only by omission.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">In order to grow old, we must not fear growing old. The biggest problem that we all have, both men and women, is fear. We are afraid to live, to be alive, and to risk being ourselves.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Nothing defines us like death, and yet death is not our greatest fear, but genuinely living is the real fear. We have all had bad luck, bad breaks, heartbreak, or things didn’t turn out the way we wanted them, however, we and the world still keep going.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p19\"><span class=\"s1\">We have to get old.  We have no choice, but we continue to hold in pain and, with every breath, we don’t let it out. We have to let go of pain and release it along with the blame and guilt.
