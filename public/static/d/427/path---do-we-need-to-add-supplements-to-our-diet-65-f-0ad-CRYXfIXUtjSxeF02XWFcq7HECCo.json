If you want to live longer than you do!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I eat pretty clean.  Lot&#8217;s of veggies and I don&#8217;t consume a lot of animal products.  I wouldn&#8217;t think that I need to add supplements to my diet.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe a more valid point would be, if mother nature intended for me to have the right vitamins and minerals, they would already be included in the foods that I eat.  Especially when I eat a wide variety as it is.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The truth is, you should add supplements to your diet if you want to fight disease and have a longer life span.  Diet alone can&#8217;t do this.  With supplements, we get the extra boost needed to have a better quality of life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Put in another way, I once read that &#8220;supplements are to humans what fertilizer is to plants.&#8221;  That statement makes sense doesn&#8217;t it?  So the question is, water, sunlight and grow? Or, water, sunlight, fertilizer and thrive?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, a good diet does the body good.  A good diet with supplements makes the body thrive!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If supplements are so important, how did our ancestors survive without supplements?  If you look back, most didn&#8217;t live that long.  Sure, even if we don&#8217;t supplement and we have a poor diet, genetically, we can survive into our 40&#8217;s and 50&#8217;s.  However, if we eat a optimum diet with supplementation, we may be able to live until we are 100 years old!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don&#8217;t wan&#8217;t to live to be whatever age if I don&#8217;t have a good quality of life. I&#8217;ve been to nursing homes plenty of times and it was heart breaking to see people sitting in wheel chairs all lined up against the wall.  To me, I felt like they were just stuck there until it was time to die.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know we are all going to get old and we&#8217;re all going to die but, it&#8217;s the way that we&#8217;re going to do it that is important.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s important that you don&#8217;t just start taking random supplements because some can have adverse effects on your health like, taking iron if you don&#8217;t need it, etc.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I would advise that you talk to a professional.  Maybe a nutritionist.  I&#8217;m not sure if doctors know about nutrition these days as they are probably overloaded as it is trying to keep up with our general healthcare requirements.  You will also need a blood test.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have created a &#8220;<strong><em>Better Health/Anti-Aging Supplement Guide</em></strong>&#8221; that I use and I swear by. You can download it from the link below.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;m not some fanatic meaning, I don&#8217;t believe that we have to take handfuls of supplements.  We just need some basic ones and I&#8217;ve put the link below if you want to check them out.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As always though, please check with your doctor before starting a supplement program because they also can interfere with medication.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So the take away here is eat a variety of nutritious foods, cut out the saturated fat and sugar, and supplement your diet for a healthier and longer life.</p>\n<p>Check out my free &#8220;2 Cheat Sheet Fast Weight Loss Formula&#8221; It&#8217;s the fastest and easiest way to lose weight in either two or four weeks!
