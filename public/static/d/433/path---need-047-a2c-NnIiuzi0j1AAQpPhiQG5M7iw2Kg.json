Gravity will take over no matter if we get fillers of not.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"> Side effects of facial fillers or the</span></h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"> &#8220;Liquid Facelift&#8221;</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The question is, do fillers increase the time that our skin will sag before it was supposed to by stretching out the skin to make it look fuller?</p>\n<p>The previous question is a catch-22 because, if we are getting fillers in the first place, then we are already having issues with the way that we perceive how we look and the gamble to stretch out our skin later is an even exchange for what we want at that moment.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s kind of like getting a tan.  You know later you might pay for it but, at the moment it looks good now.</p>\n<p>I think the question becomes or the answer is if we &#8220;need&#8221; fillers (not before we do) then it&#8217;s going to be a delicate balance between not over doing fillers and maintaining healthy skin moreover, a natural look.</p>\n<p>Then there is the other side effect or the mental side effect of fillers, and that is what I call &#8220;filler regret.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s when you get filler for the first time, and you get just the right amount, and you look pretty good and then you do more and more because of the way you looked or felt the first time that you got it.  Naturally, many of us think that more is better.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because when you get your first filler you are the youngest, you&#8217;ll ever be and as you get more filler to try and reduce the signs of aging, you convince yourself or your injector that you need more.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">We are going to age no matter what.  Just ask the people with all the money in the world!</span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No filler will ever stop the aging process and with that process, filler or no filler, gravity is going to take over, and you will look older and sometimes when getting older, the filler can make you look even older and sometimes, even, I hate to say this but, a little hideous.</p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t say her name but she is an actress, and she did an interview in a magazine about how she regretted doing fillers and over time how they not only made her look older but made her depressed about how she looked.</p>\n<p>The magazine showed before and after pictures and just as I stated already; initially, she got fillers in her early 40&#8217;s and kept going into her early 50&#8217;s (she&#8217;s 56 now) and fillers could no longer keep up with gravity.</p>\n<p>Her face kept getting bigger and puffy and she no longer had any of the facial features that she once had.</p>\n<p>On a positive note, getting a little bit of filler to balance out your face when there is lost volume can be a good thing.  Just be realistic and do it sparingly because it won&#8217;t take the place of a good cosmetic surgeon or being okay with aging itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Just a quick note.  I am putting my affiliate links to two products that I swear by below.  Vitamin C &amp; E Serum is fantastic for smoothing out and evening out your skin and, TNS Recovery Complex is amazing in that it has the most growth factors that help me with skin texture and wrinkles!</span></strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><b><i> Vitamin C + E Serum  </i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>(</i></b><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2nLH9fh\"><b><i>http://amzn.to/2nLH9fh</i></b></a><b><i>)  </i></b></li>\n<li><b><i> </i></b><b><i>TNS Recovery Complex   </i></b><b><i>(</i></b><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2oKKTLR\"><b><i>http://amzn.to/2oKKTLR</i></b></a><b><i>) </i></b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">If you seriously want smoother skin then check out my &#8220;Smooth Skin&#8221; course where I will show you exactly how I get it.  No needles, fillers or surgeons needed here!</span></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">https://how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com</span></a></h3>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<p align=\"center\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/222fb05fac8c24ca99c3702655fdb8ff/1a478/19636953_s-2.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"ef0fc2a6-2d8c-5baf-98ec-5804f00938c0"}}
