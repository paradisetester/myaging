People with social phobia have a persistent, intense, and chronic fear of being watched and judged by others and of being embarrassed or humiliated by their own actions”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Does this describe you completely or even moderately? If so as you can see, you are not alone.  Social anxiety is painful but it doesn’t mean that we have to live with it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“What others think of you is none of your business”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do you spend a lot of your time wondering and worrying about what others think about you?  Many with Social Anxiety do.  We wake up and our minds race and we worry about people and situations that may or may not occur in the day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even if they are only scenarios in our mind it causes us anxiety because of the “what if” situations we could get into.  It could be trying to create small talk with someone or trying to answer a question but feeling awkward in doing so.  Most people with Social Anxiety are very smart and yet we hide it and we hold it back for fear that we will be judged but then, we create the opposite when we hide our intelligence.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We do get judged somewhat by others because, they see and feel our anxiety.  We then judge ourselves and worse, we compare ourselves to others thinking they are better because they don’t seem to be suffering like we are.  We admire others ability to seamlessly carry on conversations and friendships like we wish we could.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Am I smart enough, pretty enough, good enough?” Feeling insecure can cause a lot of problems in our lives.  But where did this feeling come from?  When we feel like this our values are not aligned with the way we act.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We over react, we become too sensitive, we may feel inadequate even when we have accomplished many goals and usually, more so than most people.  A method to overcome this feeling is to always be aware of you judging you.  And as soon as that voice creeps up into your head fight it by saying to yourself that “It is only me judging me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">P<span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">eople don’t know you.  It is none of your business what others think of you.”  99% of the time, others are not judging you at all.  Most people are too consumed with themselves.  They are walking around in their own world too.  </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">     When we have Social Anxiety, one of the things that we think we know about others is what they are thinking.  We shouldn’t get caught up in thinking this because, we have no clue whatsoever what others are thinking. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Having self-esteem means finding a foundation and a place where you can anchor yourself.  Start by finding something you are proud of about yourself.  We all have special and unique gifts even if we don’t think we do.  Believe me you do too.  No one is better than you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are the cause of our thinking and we are also the solution to our problem.  You have heard of mind control.  Why not practice mind control for yourself?  When you understand how your mind works then you can control it.  It’s the loss of control that gets us here in the first place.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If I can offer one tip to help overcome Social Anxiety that is, to know that you can&#8217;t control the outside and that you can only control you and your thoughts.  Start with a few minutes a day 🙂</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And of course you are amazing too!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"22748763-6046-554d-a3aa-3b954a0f9f8d"}}
