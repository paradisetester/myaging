Do you distract yourself with phone calls, the Internet, friends and chaos, anything that keeps you from doing what you were meant to be doing? You were meant to be doing meaning, doing what God put you on this earth to do and doing what your spirit drives you to do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe you don’t think you know what that is. Everyone has at least a few things they are good at and even some things that they excel at, at least one of them. The problem is we resist what we need to do to find out who we were meant to be. Do you resist who you were meant to be?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You are probably wondering what the heck I am talking about and maybe thinking, <em>Where is the writer going with this?</em> Or saying to yourself, <em>I don&#8217;t resist anything, but I live each day and do what I need to do</em>. What exactly is resistance? Did you know that doctors estimate that eighty percent of their patients come in with non-health-related issues? We are not sick, but dramatic!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes I said it. We are dramatic and doctors have to treat our drama like we have a medical condition, even when they can see that we may not. Even when we too know that we do not. We need attention, and with this attention we avoid what is happening in our lives. We go outside of ourselves for justification to keep resisting who we are.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We want validation for why we resist in the first place and that’s why we look outside of ourselves. If we are preoccupied, then we can continue to resist what we must do. Resistance can mean something as small as staying in the bathtub for too long when you know you should be getting ready to leave to try to be more productive at work. Or, it can be as big as putting off larger responsibilities that never get done. There is a price, whether big or small, when resisting life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some of us go from this condition to that condition; one gets cured and another one occurs. This is how we resist. We have one crisis after another and another but the drama, or the condition we have, is still <em>resistance,</em> which keeps repeating itself. If we don’t get out of our own way, we will get stuck. And the reason we get stuck is because we resist the art of who we are meant to be. Art is what we are put on this earth for.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am not talking about the kind of art as in painting or sculpting. This art is the gift of creation that we all possess. It’s different for everyone, but we all have it inside. By resisting, we avoid our true self and we cultivate and create conditions or situations so that we keep going in circles. That’s why many of us get nowhere . . . well, at least where we imagine ourselves to be. Not to say having a successful life of some sort is a bad thing. The difference is having the courage and the commitment to completely have the life you dream of.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we resist who we are meant to be, we manipulate the world around us. We live in the victim mode, which is the antithesis of doing the work necessary to become who we are meant to be. If you are living like this, stop and take a good look at yourself, and if there is something you have always wanted to do or someone you have always wanted to be, stop resisting it and give in and do the work necessary to get there. You will find it is much easier to stop resisting than it is to take the steps to get there.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have all heard that it takes more work to pretend to work than it does to actually do the work. I have always believed that most of us wouldn’t resist if we knew what steps to take in the first place. I also believe that if we did know, many of us would have already created a better life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no formula for it either, only action. Sure, there are those who are born with a gift and they are on a journey from the time they are born. But for most of us, it’s a journey of discovery. That’s the key, it’s a journey of discovery. It takes one step at a time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It doesn’t have to be difficult, but because we think it will be we allow resistance to kick in and we throw in the towel, and then only dream of who we could be. Worse, we burden others with our stories of what we would have done or will do someday. No one wants to hear a story other than his or her own. The best way to show others our stories is to talk the talk and walk the walk.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"18d69d48-0a66-5209-b563-fd1e4b53fa7c"}}
