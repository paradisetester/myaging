Â I am assuming that you already know how to clean your face to remove daily pollution and grime that contributes to aging skin so, I won&#8217;t go into it now.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Always start with a clean face, neck, and chest.</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Again, assuming that you have wrinkles or sun damage and that some or all of your skin on your face, neck, and chest needs attention. Â The following steps are what you&#8217;ll need to do to have younger, firmer and more youthful skin.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">&#8220;4 Step Blueprint On</span></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">How To Look Good For Your Age.&#8221;</span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Step #1 &#8211; REPAIR PHASE</strong></span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Repair: Â There are four phases which meanÂ four products to use in the repair phase.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>PRODUCT #1</strong> &#8211; <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2ozdgjw\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>Vitamin C-Serum in the morning on your face, neck, and chest and top of hands. Â Following the productÂ directions.</em></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>PRODUCT #2</strong> &#8211; <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>Use an under eye cream. Â Use morning and night. Â </em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>PRODUCT #3</strong> &#8211; <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Stem Cell Complex on the face, neck, and chest. Â Use morning and night.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>PRODUCT #4</strong> &#8211; <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">A good moisturizerÂ on face, neck, and chest. Â Morning and night.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Apply each step as per product instructions and let the product absorb for a few minutes in between.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>MISTAKE: Â Not letting the products absorb before applying the next one. Â Give products about 3 to 5 minutes in between applying.</strong></span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Don&#8217;t be afraid to use the necessary amount for best results, however; you don&#8217;t need to use too much either. Â You&#8217;ll just waste your money. Â Correctly applying them will ensure your best results.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Step #2 &#8211; THE REVERSE Â PHASE</strong></span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step #2 is the step where you will create new skin! Â It&#8217;s amazing.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>PRODUCT #1</strong> &#8211; <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Do an at-home skin peel. Â  Skin peels are super effective with today&#8217;s technology, and you should start off with a mild peel and COMPLETELY FOLLOW the directions!</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As you progress, you can build up your tolerance and go stronger. But PLEASE! FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I do aÂ peelÂ every two weeks and usually on a Sunday.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/2016/10/02/let-get-fat-age/mepicture-4/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1395\">Â </a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>A little secret that I have found and that isÂ if you want firmer and tighter skin for an evening, Â more like a temporary benefit for the first eight to ten hours while you&#8217;re out on the town, do your peel the morning before your event. Then apply moisturizer and BAMM! Your skin will look beautiful.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>However, just like Cinderella, the night will come to an end and so will the temporary tightness leading into the next day where you will begin to see flaking, dryness, maybe some cracking (depending how deep and what peel you&#8217;ve used) but, don&#8217;t let it worry you. Underneath that flaking, etc. is new collagen trying to repair the wound that the peel created by bringing new and fresh skin in its place.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>MISTAKE: Never do a peel while you are healing from a previous one as this could damage and scar your skin. I do them twice a month and usually of a Sunday.</strong></span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">AGAIN! PLEASE FOLLOW THE PEEL INSTRUCTIONS AND BUILD AS YOU WATCH HOW YOUR SKIN REACTS. Â </span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I guarantee that if you keep up the consistency, you will have fabulous skin even if it&#8217;s damaged right now. Â You&#8217;ll see your lines go away, deep wrinkles soften, brown spots disappear and your skin will have a more even and luminescent appearance.</span></em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Step #3 &#8211; THE CREATE NEW SCAFFOLDING AND COLLAGEN Â PHASE</strong></span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PRODUCT #1</strong>Â  &#8211; <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Use a retinoid. Â Preferably a prescription strength and you&#8217;ll get the prescription from your local doctor or dermatologist. Â This is the best product on the list. Â This product will change your skin like nothing else will. Â Well except for the step #4 the protect phase.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Step #4 &#8211; THE PROTECT PHASE</strong></span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PRODUCT #1 &#8211;<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> ALWAYS USE SUNSCREEN. Â ESPECIALLY USING THE ABOVE PRODUCTS. Â </span></strong></p>\n<p>Your skin will be very sensitive to the sun just like a baby&#8217;s skin is. Â This is the goal of your skin to get it back to that smooth, soft and plump skin that it once was.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Keep sunscreen it in your car, purse, office, everywhere. Â A mineral sunscreen with SPF of 50 is a good one for your face, neck, and chest and hands.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>When you get into your car, use products like Oil of OlayTM facial moisturizer with at least SPF 30 if not 50 SPF for your hands. Â </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>I like this product because it&#8217;s not greasy and absorbs right in, quickly. Â Use anything that you feel you will use consistently. Â Nothing gives away our age like the hands and neck.</strong></span></p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t protect your skin, then everything that you&#8217;ve done up until this point will be wasted and there is no sense in spending money and time on yourself if sunscreen is not a part of the equation.</p>\n<p>Many of us put a little sunscreen on in the morning or have Â SPF 15 in our makeup but, that&#8217;s honestly not enough.</p>\n<p>You get more damage from everyday sun exposure over time than you do from sitting in the direct sun now and then.</p>\n<p>Sunscreen needs to be reapplied as it breaks down after two hours. Â We can&#8217;t just dab sunscreen on in the morning and then forget about it.</p>\n<p>SOLUTION: Â We all know that it&#8217;s kind of hard to reapply sunscreen on our face while we have makeup on during the day. Â So after applying a healthy amount to my face, neck, and chest, I usually carry a dry mist sunscreen and spray it on myself once or twice per day afterward. Â Okay at least once ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>I keep light cotton wraps, sunglasses, and hats in my car. Â I keep Oil Of Olay moisturizer with 50 SPF at all times in my car and every time I get in, and I quickly moisturize my hands, and I keep reapplying too.</p>\n<p>The wraps don&#8217;t keep the sun out entirely but, they do help while I am driving. Â If you drive a lot like I do, then chances are you probably have some brown spots on your left side.</p>\n<p>I hope that you do these four steps because I know that if you do, within about thirty days or so, you will see amazing results and over time, it will continue to get better and better. Â You&#8217;ll see ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Just a quick note.
