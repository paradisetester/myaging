{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN","content":"<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008080;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;ve been doing rejuvenation programs for a couple of decades now.  I have to say that I don&#8217;t do the extremes of colon cleanses or drinking juice for seven days straight or any other rigid things. Heck, I wasn&#8217;t to be happy and not miserable! Frankly, I like eating, and I like having a full life.  Thank you very much.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> I have never been sold on living a rigid life as in detoxing or starving myself. Did you know that you don&#8217;t even have to detox your body?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">However,  allowing our bodies not to have to work so hard by taking a break from meat and chemicals and, finding daily peace to reconnect outside of the busy world that we live in is a whole different thing.  It&#8217;s called <strong>rejuvenation</strong> instead of the rigidness of <em>detoxing</em>.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Honestly, it&#8217;s pretty easy to rejuvenate and what I have found through my research is that we don&#8217;t need to detox so much as we need to steer clear of daily things that harm our body, mind, and soul.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008080;\">HOW TO REJUVENATE</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Truth be known, if we have to make ourselves detox, then we probably shouldn&#8217;t be doing what needs to be detoxed in the first place.  This is the part of detox that I believe in.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don&#8217;t worry; I&#8217;m not going to go into how you should take a holistic journey so that I can convince you to cross over into the world of meditation, yoga, and veganism.  Although if you do this or learn to, it&#8217;s a pretty amazing feeling.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I believe that there are many ways to a path of contentment and mine is writing, contemplating and cooking.  Just like there are many different religions, one way doesn&#8217;t fit everyone and for that, finding what makes your spirit connected is your meditation and yoga.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your body doesn&#8217;t need for you to do anything drastic to keep it running smoothly.  The idea of drinking a tonic of green veggies and then washing away all of the bad that we have done to it is only a myth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just a made up term used by marketers so that they can scare you and then sell you the &#8220;<strong>detox cure</strong>.&#8221;  It&#8217;s not true.  There is no such cure because you don&#8217;t need it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me clarify something while I&#8217;m on the subject.  There are detox programs that are beneficial, and that is for alcohol, smoking, and drugs.  But, for now, we are merely talking about our everyday lives of overeating, over consuming and overusing chemicals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your body is healthy, you already have the perfect detoxification systems, and that is your liver and kidneys.  Our body is so remarkable at healing itself that it does this even in the worst conditions, even when we inflict bad daily habits.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So rather than try and convince you that you need to take drastic measures to detoxify your body, I&#8217;m going to state the fact that our bodies already do this and us going to the extremes of punishing ourselves to feel <em>psychologically</em> better about doing so, is not the answer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>I&#8217;m going to propose a different scenario, and that is rather than &#8220;detox&#8221; one should &#8220;rejuvenate.&#8221;</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You might be asking yourself what is the difference between detox and rejuvenation?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They sound like the same thing right?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The answer is that detox is an extreme measure that has no validation other than in the marketing and the entrepreneurial world.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, let&#8217;s be real here.  Rejuvenation is about a lifestyle.  A way to reverse disease, turn back the clock, feel more energetic and extend your lifespan.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rejuvenation is the ultimate detox because it is living a life of rejuvenation and that is healthy living, living in moderation and exercising.  Of course, this means not smoking, not over drinking and eating a healthy diet.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Mediterranean diet comes to mind which is characterized especially by high consumption of vegetables and olive oil and moderate consumption of protein.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A Vegetarian or Vegan diet is also fantastic.  ( I know that I said I wasn&#8217;t trying to get you to become for a Vegan, but it&#8217;s a good plan if you wanted to.  Just saying 🙂 )</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For myself, I eat a vegan diet of 60% vegetables, 20% protein and about 20% healthy carbohydrates at most meals and a snack of nuts or smoothies in between.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> I get off track from time to time, but when I do, I enjoy it and then get right back to my healthy eating.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I feel great, and that&#8217;s all that matters.  If you eat a healthy diet, you will feel great, and if you feel great then, you&#8217;re doing something right. Right?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So now we know that our bodies don&#8217;t need detox programs because we already have a super efficient detox system which is or liver and kidneys.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, when we drink alcohol, our liver breaks it down in a two-step process, and then our kidneys wash it away.  Did you know that broccoli and other greens, even brown rice produce cyanide?  Our liver takes care of these too.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008080;\"><em>Now let&#8217;s move on to Rejuvenation and what it is.  </em></span></h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008080;\"><em>THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</em></span></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Rejuvenation</em> is the same as renewal.  It&#8217;s different from detox in that it&#8217;s not about deprivation but more about eating healthy, supplementing, exercising regularly, minimizing stress and, avoiding exposure to toxins that will hurt you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Very few of us reach our potential and maximum lifespan.  Instead, we die too soon because of disease caused by free radical damage.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We will start with the American diet which is high fat and processed foods, full of preservatives and, full of chemicals. This is the start of the free radical damage.  A diet like this is a free radical overload.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>Examples of these foods would be meat, butter, white flour, alcohol, sugar.</strong></em></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008080;\">The foundation for Rejuvenation and promoting longevity is:</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Maximize antioxidant intake with food and supplements.  Minimize what causes free radicals.</strong></p>\n<h4>Here are the basics that will help you minimize free radicals:</h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><em>Eat organic.</em></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><em>Drink purified water.</em></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><em>Avoid chemicals including hairspray, perfume, glue, paint, smoke and any chemicals you can.  I know, we live in real life, and we can&#8217;t get away from them.  But really, you can if you are mindful of them in the first place.</em></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><em>Avoid pollutants.</em></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><em>Only get X-Rays when necessary.</em></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><em>Only take medications when necessary (always check with your doctor and don&#8217;t stop any meds. before doing so).</em></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Avoid animal products.</span></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Supplement</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take this quote my Thomas Edison &#8220;<em>The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame, in diet, and in the cause and prevention of disease.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That&#8217;s the thing about rejuvenation.  Once you get started, you won&#8217;t have to worry one bit about your body because your body will do what it is naturally programmed to do and that is to detox and heal itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, I know that we will get older and we will die.  I know, no one is getting out of here alive.  However, just because we get older doesn&#8217;t mean that we can&#8217;t feel and look our best even better than we did when were-were much younger.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In closing, we have a choice when it comes to extending our life, and that is we can sabotage it and accelerate the aging and disease process we can swing the pendulum in the direction of everyday choices and lifestyle commitments that give us the ticket to optimal health and maximum longevity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have created a 7 Day Quick Start To Rejuvenating Your Body, and you can get it here free.
