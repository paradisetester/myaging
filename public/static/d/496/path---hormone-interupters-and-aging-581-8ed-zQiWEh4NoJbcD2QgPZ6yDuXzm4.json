{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"HORMONE INTERUPTERS AND AGING","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">HORMONES INTERRUPTERS AND AGING</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I will start with pesticides and how they affect our hormones.  Many of the most widely used pesticides are known to copy estrogenic hormones.  This is because they firmly bind to hormone receptor sites in the body.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Endocrinology strange things are happening to our bodies, moreover to our younger youth.  Although some may deny that there is a connection between pesticides and hormone related issues, however, the fact is, even in minute doses, they can cause abnormal functions of our immune system, reproductive system, and central nervous system.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example PCB’s are in the environment and can act like thyroid hormone.  I myself was recently diagnosed with thyroid disease and so was my mother, sister in law, friends and co-workers.  I have wondered if there is something causing this other than our own natural deterioration.  When most everyone you know is on the same medication with the same diagnoses, I believe something is happening and, some questions should be answered.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then there is Dioxin in bleached products we consume which depletes sperm production and does other harmful things.  Nonylphenols that are added to plastic also mimics estrogen.  I can keep going and add to the list but you get the picture.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don’t forget, the government and corporations used to tell us that asbestos, PCB’s and DDT were all deemed safe and effective, yet all of these chemicals have since been banned. (http://www.collective-evolution.com/2014/09/13/chemical-found-in-colgate-total-toothpaste-linked-to-cancer/)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, I am not writing this to create fear, nor do I want you to live in a bubble, that’s not the point.  What I do want to convey is for you to understand that certain chemicals and pesticides disrupt the endocrine system.  This is the system that balances out our hormones.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In upcoming posts, I will give you ways to avoid these while not having to live a rigid life while trying to do so.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"d5ec03a5-9ec7-50a4-8e6a-e2af6248f130"}}
