Â I hate being hungry. Â I especially hate how my stomach hurts when I&#8217;m hungry. Â I don&#8217;t like feeling light headed either and, I absolutely hate looking for healthy food options when I&#8217;m starving.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;\">11 Ways to curb your appetite</span></strong></span></p></blockquote>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"text-align: center;\">Be prepared. Â Always have a low calorie meal/snack with you at all times so that as soon as you get that hungry feeling, you can eat!</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Â East small meals often. Â I try and eat about five to six times a day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Â Eat protein and veggies and try and keep it to no more than 300 calories each time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Â Sip on hot cups of veggie broth throughout the day. Â This warms and soothes the stomach and, provides lot&#8217;s of healthy benefits.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Â Drink a couple of dark green veggie smoothies during the day. Â Throw a couple of hand fulls of kale, a hand full of blueberries, some almond milk and, Stevia Sweetener.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This will be about 125 calories or so and you&#8217;ll get your greens and your fill. Â Great for hair, skin and nails too. Â I know because I&#8217;ve seen my hair grow about three inches since doing this for the past nine months!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For even better results, add in some probiotics (open a couple of capsules). Â AMAZING!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6. Â When dining out. Â Don&#8217;t let the server bring bread or any appetizer and then, eat the meal that you want but, ask for a to go box right away and box half of your meal. Â You can eat the other half later or the next day!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7. Â If you have to eat a lot (like I do) then SPIRALIZE! This is using an attachment to make spaghetti zucchini noodles and then cut up a tomatoe, one teaspoon olive oil, salt, pepper, shredded basil and, a tablespoon of Parmesan cheese.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heat in microwave for about two minutes. Â It&#8217;s lovely and filling and, about 160 calories!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8. Â When you do eat a meal, consume lot&#8217;s of veggies. Â I eat 80% veggies and then 20% protein. Â Others will tell you to probably reverse this and yes, protein does make you feel fuller however, I think with regards to health and aging, we absolutely need those phytonutrients that plants provide rather than too much protein which is acidic to the body. Plants neutralize our body.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">9. Â When you want to eat, step back and ask yourself if you are really hungry? Â Is it habit, boredom or, are you actually hungry? Â If you are, then eat! Â If you can wait, go do something for a while and come back to eating.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">10. Â Always have small GO TO meals in your fridge or freezer to pop in the microwave, that way you won&#8217;t stand in pantry grazing and over eating.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">11. Â Okay, number eleven is a mini list ðŸ™‚ Â Hydrate, get enough sleep, drink hot green tea, take in Â tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, keep tempting food out of the house, use small plates for your meals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This isn&#8217;t a diet of any kind. Â Only mindful ways to keep you from over eating, eating when you&#8217;re not hungry or, binge eating because of boredom.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What I also do is, when I find myself constantly thinking about eating while at home, I take my keys, jump in my car and go the mall and WALK around. Â Of course I always find something that I don&#8217;t need but, I&#8217;m working on that too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/207274a219ea1b2a25032cda16616adc/1a478/4547024_s-400x280.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"db8b562a-296a-5b8c-8972-f44d97669ca6"}}
