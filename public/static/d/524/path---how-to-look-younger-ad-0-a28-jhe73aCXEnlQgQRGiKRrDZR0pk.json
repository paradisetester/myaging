As people want less invasive</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">beauty procedures they are turning more toward anti-aging products that work well and</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">that really change their skin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Time spent on personal appearance takes on added importance as we age. Men and</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">women want to retain the looks they had when they were younger. Of course, we can’t</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">go back, but we can age gracefully.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the short-term, we’ll spend money on anti-aging products that we hope will prevent us</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">from having cosmetic surgery procedures. We’ll spend money on anti-aging products</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">that counter the visible signs of aging, thus, as we age, our spending will intensify.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the long-term, we’ll either have to face the effects of aging skin or give into the</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">cosmetic procedures we had once hoped to avoid. By using effective anti-aging</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">products, we can prolong the need for cosmetic surgery and hopefully, get to a place</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">where it’s not as important as it once was.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The revolutionizing factor is technology. Technology will create more effective products</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">that penetrate the skin rather than sit on top of it. We already have products that use</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">nanotechnology, where the molecules are so small the delivery system is able to deeply</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">penetrate the skin, thus, delivering the optimal amount of ingredients that effectively</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">make a difference to our skin. In the future, we will use one product with all the</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">capabilities of many products, instead of the three or four currently sitting on our</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">shelves.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At this time, knowing that taking care of your skin before it becomes damaged by FREE</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RADICALS, such as the environment and the sun, is the best defense. However, if</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">you’re like me and have damaged skin from too much sun exposure, and you’re now</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">concerned with how to reverse the damage, I’ll show you how. I call this, “Reverse Engineering your skin.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We all know that as we age our skin becomes dull and tired. We are at the mercy of our environment and how well we take care of our skin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are a variety of reasons our skin ages faster than we’d like and many are due to our lifestyle, diet, heredity, the environment and, our daily habits.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. The loss of skin elasticity (wrinkles, sagging).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Loss of volume (collagen).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Bone changes (the bones become thinner).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We all age at different rates. Some of us require surgical intervention sooner than others. In general, we all end up aging about the same. Some of the aging issues that many of us also deal with are thickening texture, thinning skin, dryness, and, brown spots.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The changes that occur below the skin, such as fat loss, bone loss, and cartridge loss at the nose, among other factors, can only be fixed with fillers and fat transfer. Contrary to what cosmetic companies want us to believe, there isn’t a topical product that will create and make a difference in volume.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, products like Retin-A will help, as it stimulates collagen, but it won’t make significant volume changes like fillers or fat transfer. Retin-A is more for texture and exfoliating as it helps create new skin faster.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Smoking is an absolute skin ager, no matter what age you are and, it only gets worse with time. Facial movement causes lines that become visible after the skin starts losing its elasticity. As people reach their thirties and forties, lines will “appear horizontally on the forehead, vertically on the skin above the root of the nose (glabella), or as small curved lines on the temples, upper cheeks and around the mouth.”(webmd.com/effects of aging of the skin).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, as you can see, it doesn’t look good for our skin as we age, however, with prevention starting in our twenties and beyond we can create a more youthful appearance by using products with ingredients that actually work. But what about now, you might ask? What about if you are forty and over? “What can we do now?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In my next post, I will show you how to look younger..</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Check out my free &#8220;2 Cheat Sheet Fast Weight Loss Formula&#8221; It&#8217;s the fastest and easiest way to lose weight in either two or four weeks!
