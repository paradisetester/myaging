{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"What are you meant to do?","content":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">What are you meant to do?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What are you meant to do? What gifts do you possess that you have not yet discovered within yourself? That’s a rhetorical question because, if you knew what gift or gifts you had, then it would already be discovered, right? Well, not really.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You could be fantastic at many different things and you may not even realize it. These are the gifts that others see within you or that you are really good at. I cook a lot and I cook for a lot of people.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a matter of fact, those who I cook for tell me I should open a restaurant, be a chef or a caterer. I was told this for many years, but I wasn’t hearing it. I just took their words with a grain of salt and thought they were only compliments I was being given as a token for making them food.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, even though I was good at it, I believed it was just my hobby, and sometimes when you try and turn your hobby into a job, you don’t enjoy it anymore. I didn’t want a job; I wanted to continue having a hobby to relax and enjoy myself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sometimes we are born with certain talents. Well, not sometimes. I believe we all have at least one or two or even three, maybe more. Cooking is my natural gift, but writing is what I love to do. So there are two things I have to work with.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Surely either one of these will make me happy if I pursue them. What is your natural gift? If you don’t know, think about what others always tell you that you are good at. If you are passionate about something but feel you can’t do it for a living, then do it part-time. You must do what your soul calls you to do, otherwise, you are only working to pay bills and then die. On the other hand, if you like what you do and it’s paying your bills, then maybe this is what you are supposed to be doing and this conversation is moot.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are more people working in fields that they don’t hold a degree in and, usually, it’s not by choice. We usually have to go where the money pays the bills and, before long, we are stuck in a job we don’t like or one that doesn’t challenge us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don’t know one person in my life who absolutely loves what they do for a living. They are okay with what they do, but they don’t love it. Maybe not all of us are lucky enough to love what we do, however, it’s worth it to try to do the work that we have a passion for.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have you honestly taken the time to find out what you are made of, or do you know you should find out but continue to put it off? As the saying goes, “Someday I will get to it”, as in cleaning your closet or organizing your drawers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me light a fire underneath you and remind you that <em>someday</em> will never come. What will come instead is “a road to nowhere.” Someday is when you wake up and you are literally too old to do what you should have done, only now you mourn the loss of what you can’t do anymore.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yeah, I know, we are never too old to live our dream, but yes you are. If you want to live in Alaska for a year and live off the land, it gets pretty cold when you are in your late stages of life to do that. I can’t tell you how many times I hear, “If I were twenty years younger, I would . . .” I want to say, “Why didn’t you do it when you were twenty years younger?” I make it sound so easy, don’t I? Well, it is. If you take anything away from this, do now what you might put off later because we both know you probably won’t do it. Life gets in the way and then life flies by, and pretty soon we no longer have the opportunities we once had. What are you meant to do?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I hope you are lucky enough to find your passion 🙂</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2010653e-140c-51ef-ae1d-e29d5f39a386"}}
