And, we have so many cells.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you get down to it, why wouldn’t we help our body fight against this mass attack by consuming antioxidants and avoiding the things that cause free radicals in the first place?  See when we let our antioxidants fall below optimal then free radicals have the upper hand.  After a billion hits here and there, now you have serious cellular damage.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This type of damage not only causes disease but it’s the quickest way to aging.  Again, how to counter this is to take in generous amounts of antioxidant foods and supplements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>If you would like to get my PDF on how to get started here is the link below:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=imgedit-preview&amp;_ajax_nonce=c3b68c6a16&amp;postid=98&amp;rand=49460\" width=\"147\" height=\"147\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/the-5-huge-mistakes\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/the-5-huge-mistakes-/</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"e0743204-0263-5961-aff4-dd4c9bfb81cb"}}
