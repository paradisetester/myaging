Â Absolutely but, the important thing here is consistency.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I not only feel great knowing that for breakfast I&#8217;ve already consumed half of my daily fruits and veggies but, I physically feel energized, my hair has started to grow again and, my skin is looking pretty good too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How to have good intestinal health?
