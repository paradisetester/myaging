Yep! Cancer helpers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So if you don&#8217;t want to invite cancer into your life then start by eliminating these types of bad foods!</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Burnt foods, BBQ&#8217;d, smoked, fried</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">High fat cheese, butter, salad dressing and high fat oils</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instead, eat whole grains, legumes, fresh organic veggies, and fresh low glycemic fruits.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me tell why you should avoid the above mention bad foods.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">*The best and smartest thing we can do is to avoid high fat intake.  This in itself will help fight cancer and keep us healthy and looking young.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Frying foods creates as toxic mix.  In addition to cooking your meal, by frying your foods, you are cooking up a toxic cascade of carcinogens. It&#8217;s very wise to eliminate all fried foods.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meat is another food you might want to avoid because meats are high in fat.  In fact, women who eat meat daily have four times the breast cancer rate of women who eat meat less than once or so per week.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know, if you love meat this is a hard one to do however, maybe you can eliminate it once or twice a week.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dairy foods are made from animals and they are loaded with fat, pesticides, hormones and other toxins.  Don&#8217;t get fooled by butter substitutes either because they have large amounts of ugly fats called trans-fats.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you like eggs, try and have one egg yolk per two egg whites.  The yolks have a lot of cholesterol.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use oils sparingly.  Some are better than others like olive oil, etc. but they pack a lot of calories and more fat than you need.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Salad dressings are the foods that we don&#8217;t realize that we eat way too much of.  Standard and even the lite versions are usually high in fat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Make your own dressing by using balsamic vinegar, lemons/limes, herbs, etc.  Make it ahead and put it in a glass container to have a hand so you won&#8217;t reach for the fat dressings.  Add soy yogurt to make it creamy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though there are what is called &#8220;good fats&#8221; like in avocados and peanut butter etc. remember that a tablespoon of peanut butter is usually about 100 calories, which 90 calories of that is fat.  You should only have 10% fat in your diet so with two tablespoons of peanut butter, you&#8217;ve had your fat for the day.  Eat your fat wisely so you can enjoy it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: If you eat peanut butter make sure its organic and certified Alfatoxin free as Alflatoxin is a mold-borne carcinogen common in peanuts.  Make sure you drain the oil after opening.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lastly I will talk about snacks.  Just try and eat God made and not man made 🙂</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here&#8217;s to your health, aging well and living for a very long time. Disease free 🙂</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a style=\"font-size: 0.95em;\" href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><em>w/</em></a></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"f6ebab31-070e-5edd-a851-ee2c6725d740"}}
