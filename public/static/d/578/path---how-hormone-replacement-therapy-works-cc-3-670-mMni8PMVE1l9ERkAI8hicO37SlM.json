Our hormone levels change throughout the day, and an easy way to test this is by doing a saliva test which can determine hormonal imbalances.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, one would give saliva samples at specific times during a 24 hour period.  This has its advantages over giving blood because who would want the pain of needles when they can just give a little saliva?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And, this can be done anywhere at any time.  Saliva can remain stable for up to five days and can be mailed so the patient can perform the samples themselves and then ship them off to the lab.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, hormone levels are higher when we wake up, so it makes sense to be able to test them at home rather than to travel to a doctors office while hormone levels drop.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The saliva test cost is typically less expensive than blood tests.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Here are some of the reasons that a women&#8217;s hormones can become unbalanced:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Eating food that has hormones added to it.</li>\n<li>Consuming supplements and herbs that have an estrogenic effect.</li>\n<li>Birth control or other HRT.</li>\n<li>Environmental toxins that mimic estrogen (plastics, pesticides).</li>\n<li>Exposure to radiation.</li>\n<li>I bet you didn&#8217;t even think about this one! Chronic constipation.  Estrogen builds up in the colon and then is reabsorbed.</li>\n<li>Liver toxicity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Each person&#8217;s HRT is different because of genetics and lifestyle. It&#8217;s better to start with a baseline and then continue testing if HRT is started.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do you want to look and feel younger? Do this and have a life that will keep you happy and healthy for a lot longer than the average woman.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate.  I have created a six-step course called &#8220;The Rejuvenation Program&#8221;</span></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"> You can check it out by clicking this link: <a href=\"http://www.therejuvenationprogram.com\">http://www.therejuvenationprogram.com</a></span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8361\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8361\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8361\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png\" alt=\"The Rejuvenation Program\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-768x644.png 768w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-624x523.png 624w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-600x503.png 600w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program.png 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8361\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Rejuvenation Program</p></div>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c8af166f-6cc9-52e2-b073-611957b8e6ee"}}
