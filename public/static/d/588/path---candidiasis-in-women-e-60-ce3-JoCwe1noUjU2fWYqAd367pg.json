M.D. of Santa Monica, California).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Women on hormone replacement therapy, specifically estrogen replacement therapy, are also at risk because of changes in the vagina due to menopause, etc.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Causes of Candidiasis:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Antibiotics</li>\n<li>Diet (milk, dairy, foods that contain molds, breads, peanuts)</li>\n<li>Sugar</li>\n<li>Alcohol (This is going to be hard for me because I love my wine!)</li>\n<li>Environmental Factors ( damp environments)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have you ever felt like you were just not yourself?  People who suffer with a Candida infections sometimes have a feeling they are not themselves.  They feel that something is really wrong.  Usually doctors can’t figure this out and misdiagnose them with depression or anxiety.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are tests that can detect Candida which are Blood tests, Stool tests, Electrodermal tests.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Treating Candidiasis.  If you have ever had a chronic yeast infection, etc. you know how difficult it can be to treat them and to finally get rid of all of the symptoms.  Sometimes it takes months if not years.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You could take an antifungal drug which should be taken as a last resort.  A drug such as this should only be taken after the reduction approach is done.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Treating chronic Candidiasis requires the patients immune system to be strengthened through diet, supplements, and herbal remedies.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Diet:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Don’t eat sugar</li>\n<li>Don’t drink alcohol</li>\n<li>Don’t eat refined sugar</li>\n<li>Get a food allergy test (there is a cross associated with the food we eat)</li>\n<li>Drink pure water, often</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Supplements:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Pro-biotic</li>\n<li>Vitamin C</li>\n<li>Vitamin E</li>\n<li>Evening primrose oil</li>\n<li>Vitamin D</li>\n<li>Zinc chelate</li>\n<li>Drink pure water, often</li>\n<li>Get your Vitamin B levels checked and your iron too</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Candidiasis in women</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Herbal Remedies:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As per Dr. Braly’s first line of attack on candidiasis is caprylic acid.  He only uses drugs if there is no improvement.  “In one study, patients taking 3,600 mg of caprylic acid daily for two weeks completely eliminated their Candida.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So the theme here is about eliminating and avoiding Candida overgrowth.  How we do this is by basically eliminating all sugar and supplementing with a good probiotic.  We need to drink plenty of pure water.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The good news is that you will not only feel better regardless, you will probably eliminate other diseases along the way.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Include these foods in your diet to rid yourself of Candida:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Fresh vegetables and salads (lots and lots and organic)</li>\n<li>un-processed grains like rye or millet which don’t produce much sugar (moderation)</li>\n<li>Garlic</li>\n<li>Olive oil (thank god!)</li>\n<li>Fresh fruits like berries but, in moderation</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What I do to get the good stuff in and the bad stuff out is one, I eat a ton of vegetables each day.  Were talking 15 to 20 servings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How do I do this?  I wake up, put half of a bag of organic kale in the blender, almond milk, pure water, fresh lemon juice, frozen organic blueberries, two probiotics (I open the capsules and empty them into my blender) I add a teaspoon of Stevia (a natural plant based sweetener) and viola.~</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Blend and you have an equivalent to two salads already in just a quick morning smoothie!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And, you do you know what else this does?  It also serves as a kidney and liver cleanser when you wake up first thing in the morning. If you can’t get your veggies in, try this two or three times a day and you’ll balance out your gut in no time 🙂</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do you want to look and feel younger? Do this and have a life that will keep you happy and healthy for a lot longer than the average woman.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone aligncenter\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/19562124_s-e1478528254572.jpg\" alt=\"Candidiasis In Women\" width=\"188\" height=\"194\" /></p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\">References:  Alternative Medicine “Candidiasis” pf. 618</h6>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\">\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/d004ba7649959db38ac79e7fad5991f0/1a478/39915396_s-400x280.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"eb93745c-f016-5369-92d3-d230a2907d8f"}}
