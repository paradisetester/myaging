Part #1","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">BORN FOR WHAT</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Too many times I see people needlessly suffer and I ask myself if their suffering is really necessary. Is it they who cause the suffering, or is it because they have some seriously bad luck? Or worse, has Fate dealt them a terrible hand that their souls must endure until they die, and only then they will have freedom?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Are some people put on Earth to suffer so the rest of us can learn or have meaning? Are they the unlucky ones? We could answer this question by asking another question: Is anything really luck in the first place?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure there are times when we may be in the right place at the right time, or we may pick some lotto numbers and with some extraordinary luck, we win. This is luck and it separates real life from luck.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Living a life in conflict is different from luck because many times we battle ourselves and, therefore, we create our own luck. We create fateful situations because of the way we see the world.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know I get in my own way a lot and it’s because I’m trying to avoid something, and I only end up creating more chaos by doing this. And then the outcome is twofold. If I had a dollar for all the times that I sabotaged myself or made things more difficult than they needed to be, honestly, I would be a millionaire by now, or at least on my way to being one.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I struggle like anyone else, only now I’m more aware of my actions so I try to do it a little less. I’m not perfect and I try every day to do my best; well, most of the time. I know when I’m not doing my best and I know when events beyond my control are actually happening, or whether I’m creating them for justification.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we are born disabled, that’s not luck. No one would say, “Look at that boy with MS,” or “Look at that lady with cancer, how unlucky.” It’s not because they were unlucky that they got sick, and that we are lucky because we didn’t; it’s a matter of timing, or it’s our genetics already set in motion and it’s beyond our control.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure we could argue that we are lucky or fortunate to be of good health. And that I agree with; every second that we are alive and healthy we are lucky because there are so many who are not. But it’s not as though I earned my good health and those like my brother didn’t.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s just what was supposed to happen at some point in life. Sometimes life isn’t fair. We can say that we can’t do anything about our genetics; but then there are those who would beg to differ and say that we have absolute control over them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I disagree to a point because why do kids and babies get cancer and other diseases? They never had a chance. Sure, as we grow and take care of ourselves, we can offset genetics and hopefully avoid turning on the genes that give us cancer, such as not smoking to avoid lung cancer, or staying out of the sun to avoid skin cancer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But for the most part, we can’t control our fate. My brother had absolutely no control, no matter how hard he willed himself to be well, and in the end, it’s what his body was meant to do. Although it’s totally not fair, it is what it is.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In general, that is a true statement, but it’s not whether we are in the right place at the right time. Things that are meant to be will happen to us and that’s part of life. We are born and we are given life, and our genetics are the program that runs us for the most part.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luck has nothing to do with it otherwise. When we are pregnant, we don’t say, “I hope my luck pans out and I have a healthy baby.” No, we say, “Please God, let my baby be healthy.” Life, and for the most part of what happens throughout it, is out of our hands.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because life is not about luck, luck is only a bonus or a benefit; everything else is probably pre-destined. It’s what we do with the life we are given that is the important thing, and this is where our will comes in, along with our choices.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Choice is what separates luck from a life worth living. We can’t change the environment we are born into, or how our genes will express themselves, but we can make choices that mitigate some of the circumstances we are handed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Herein lies the choice of seeing life as full, and not empty. Look at the physicist Stephen Hawking; he is a beautiful example of a life well-lived under the most extreme circumstances. When life gave him a lemon he made more than lemonade.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just using that statement seems ridiculous because he didn’t just make lemonade, he made a lemonade machine. He made the most of the situation in the life that he was given. Though he is severely disabled, suffering from a motor neuron disease related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and is unable to even talk, he has continued to create a lifetime of accomplishments.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And, on top of it all, he maintains a sense of humor about it. The greatest thing about Stephen Hawking is that he is defined by his accomplishments and not by his disability. We need to remember that we too are defined by what we believe and by what we do, and not for what we have or don’t have, or who we are, but by how we look at ourselves and at the world. If we change our thinking, we can change our life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Please read part #2 tomorrow 🙂</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/e9d531f46f562a76daa0fd2de2d20fb6/a820e/mentalillness.jpg","width":200,"height":200}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"b963e07f-9425-5940-9159-47f9f2eb9fc8"}}
