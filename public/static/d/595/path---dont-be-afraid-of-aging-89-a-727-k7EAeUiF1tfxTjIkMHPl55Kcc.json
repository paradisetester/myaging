Let’s admit it, doors open up for us when we are young. When we’re old, we don’t get the respect we deserve. As much I hated to admit it, it wasn’t the aging that I was running from, it was the fear of the unknown that I could not come to terms with. This is the real obstacle in my aging progression.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I used to be afraid of cancer or a disease that I would die from. Now, after seeing my mother-in-law go from a Friday evening dinner as a relatively healthy and strong women to unable to wake up from a stroke on a Saturday morning, to a nursing home where she could not even feed herself, all within a week or so, made me realize two things:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One, that life is really short so quit living in fear and just start living in the moment, and two, that a nursing home is no place to live. So while we are capable we must use every moment to live and use our bodies.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">God sure does show up to teach us just at the right moment; when we are questioning our own existence. In Buddhism they say, “When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.” It’s a sad reminder, and the reality of where we all end up.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’m not saying anything negative about reputable nursing homes, God bless them, but we all know how depressing they can be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I walk in the nursing home I am completely in the moment, deeply grateful and extremely aware of every fiber of my being. I want to run out of there and scream at the top of my lungs about how grateful I am to be healthy, alive, and for the opportunity to walk out of there and be me, the person I have taken for granted lately.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have the opportunity and the great fortune to leave, and they never will. I feel that I’ve won the lottery of life and they have lost. How beautiful is it to have everything, and to be awakened to appreciate it?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I walk through the halls to my mother-in-law’s room, I mourn for the people lined up against the walls, left in their wheelchairs to deteriorate until their final day arrives. Seeing it in their eyes as I walk by, while trying not to look into their eyes, I see many wish that that final day will come sooner than later.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I tell myself it’s not fair to get to an age and then be tossed aside. But I know it’s in God’s hands, and I only hope he is taking care of them in his own way,, and I hope they are feeling that he is too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I see people who were once happy and vibrant, and had the world in front of them as I do now. I realize how close I am to where I will be, and I am stricken with the reality that I better start living with gratitude and appreciation this minute, and not live in a future that may or may not come.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Right now, today is all I have. I need to stop wasting my life fearing my future. I know that one day, I will look back at pictures of my middle-aged self I am so afraid of, and say, “Look how young you really were.”</p>\n<p>If you would like to get my PDF on how to age better click the link below:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=imgedit-preview&amp;_ajax_nonce=c3b68c6a16&amp;postid=98&amp;rand=92813\" width=\"131\" height=\"131\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/the-5-huge-mistakes/\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/the-5-huge-mistakes/</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/f32e3cfae597792deccf7b46e5af15a2/1a478/21783809_l1-400x280.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"1450803a-4cc1-500e-a78a-1e20c66c5f07"}}
