{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Born for what? Part #2","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are those who walk among us who have never been in the right place at the right time. In fact, there is never a right place or a right time for them, as every time and every place they land is not right. They drift, they get lost and they go through life with one setback after another.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Disasters always occur, tragedies happen, and they are always waiting for the next interference that will affect their lives. They wait for it and it always shows up just as they had expected it would. These are the people who live their entire lives never to find happiness and never to feel authentic joy. Contentment is a word they will never know.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They look at others as being more fortunate than they are, and this reinforces their beliefs that they are not good enough and don’t deserve what others have. I once heard someone say that they didn’t deserve Christmas presents. Though this sounds so trivial, this person really meant it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He is the nicest person with the biggest heart, and believe me, if anyone was deserving, he certainly was. It broke my heart to see someone in such pain who thought he wasn’t worthy of even a single gift. And it’s not the Christmas presents that are the gift, but the love of those who wanted to give him the gifts that mattered. ­Unfortunately, that was my own son.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Throughout the years, I haven’t always had the best life, but I have had a lot of lucky breaks, and I had many people along the way who wanted to help me for some reason or another. I realize that I have been very blessed, and this is one of those circumstances where luck comes in.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For whatever reason I, unlike my brother, have been helped, encouraged and handed things without having to ask. For this, I am very fortunate. I know this isn’t the case for a lot people, and for some they have rough and difficult lives. Sometimes, even when those who are lost and have the support around them, they still flounder and have difficult and troubled lives.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their lives on earth are troubled and painful. For those people, only they know their pain. We who appear to be strong will never comprehend the pain they are in. We may say, “Cheer up, what’s wrong, why can’t you be happy?” And all they really want is to be all of those things, and in fact, they want it more than we know.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For some of us, it’s pretty easy to get up, get dressed, breeze over to the coffee pot and think about how great our day will be. For others, just getting out of bed and facing the day is daunting, and not because they are depressed, although they could be, but because they see the world as just another day to get through, and they see no joy, have no hope and have nothing to look forward to. It may be all in their thinking, but they are thinking it just the same.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know that I am fortunate, and I try to never forget that I am very blessed to have good health and to be a person of sound mind. I believe that if you have these two things, you can have a good life. I know through disease, genetics and outside forces, life and circumstances can change this in a blink of an eye.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we are born, is our fate already decided? Are we born with a blank slate and unlimited choices to become whoever we desire to be? Or, is fate predestined, and we are not born with unlimited choices at all, but only a limited number of choices that have already been laid out for us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is it this dynamic that is the reason why some people fall victim to themselves, the environment, disease or something that doesn’t allow them to live in the light, but rather keep them in the dark?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s as though some of us live in a constant hell because we are desperately trying to escape who we were destined to be. The question becomes: are troubled lives merely a product of fighting what was meant to be?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One would have to ponder this question because there has to be a reason why others don’t struggle when so many do. Think about it, many people go effortlessly through life, while others have to fight every minute of every day for some sort of existence, some sort of peace and some sort of normalcy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Part #3 continued tomorrow..</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"e8baff46-bd6b-574b-8114-256d170710aa"}}
