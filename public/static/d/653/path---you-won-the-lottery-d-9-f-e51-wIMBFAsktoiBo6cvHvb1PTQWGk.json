I tell them; you bought a lottery ticket on Thursday and on Saturday your numbers were called.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Each and every one of your numbers matched! How exciting would that be? In fact, you would see your whole life pass before you. Your past, your present and what you hope will now be an amazing future. You have the kind of energy that is exhilarating, the kind that you where you don’t want to sleep or eat, but just dream of how happy you will be. No more worries, you think.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You prepare to collect your earnings, still reeling that you of all people won the lottery. You think how lucky you are when the phone rings and it’s your doctor’s office calling to give you last week’s mammogram results (because now we have to get them each year). You secure your lottery ticket in your wallet, after dreaming of the things you will buy and do with your new found wealth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the mean time, your doctor would like for you to come in to the office to read over the results of your mammogram from last week. He never called before, but maybe that’s not so unusual you think. You get to the appointment, you see the doctor and he says he has terrible news.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em> “You have advanced breast cancer and it’s also metastasized into your lungs and your bones.” </em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You try to swallow to feel any type of reality that has just left your body, but you don’t feel anything, just a huge hole filled with fear. Your chest feels heavy and you feel your body go limp. He says, “I am sorry.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At best you may have three months to live. You should get your affairs in order.” He asks if he can call your family. “There is nothing at this point we can do to treat it.” Your life just stops!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s that thing that hits you out of nowhere on a Tuesday afternoon, like life seems to do. Your doctor pats your shoulder, and tells you to let them know if you have any questions or if there is anything he can do for you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You get up from your chair in utter shock and despair. You can’t cry because you can’t feel anything. You are so numb you can barely move, but you get yourself up and make it to your car.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After who knows how long, you sit in your car and you begin to talk to God. Your life flashes by and you wonder how you will tell your family the news. You say, “God, how could you do this to me?” “How could you let me die when I am not ready to? I am too young to die.” You begin to bargain with God.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lottery ticket is the furthest from your mind at this point. You tell God you will do anything if he will let you live. “Let me live to love my kids, my grandkids, let me keep my life. Please don’t let me die, God, I don’t want to die.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You feel the presence of God in your car and he allows you to know what he thinks about your plea for a moment, and then says, “I will make a deal with you. I will let you live but you have to give up your lottery ticket. You will no longer be rich and I will give you your life back. You must go back to the life you had.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You don’t blink, you don’t even think twice, and you say, “Yes, yes, yes! I will give up all materials and money to have my life back.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">YOUR LIFE BACK? The one you already have right now. The one you didn’t appreciate when you bought the lottery ticket. The not-so-good life you had when you bought the lottery ticket so you could escape the life you now want back. The one you would give anything to have again.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Would you die for that new life? Or would you give back the lottery ticket to keep the life you have now? You don’t have to die for what is already in your hands.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You have already won the lottery because you have your health and, therefore, you have your life. The gift that no money can buy, and you already own it. You don’t have to wish for it, you don’t have to long for it, you only need to be thankful to have it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fortune of health is, therefore, your precious life. Appreciate it, because it won’t last forever, and it too will be gone in a blink. Next time, God may not bargain with you. On this day, you are a winner. Go out and enjoy your prize. You are your jackpot!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No one person’s, or generation’s time is more valuable than the other. Time is just as important to any of us, no matter what age we are. We can go and be who we have always wanted to be, we have a job to do, a calling to enact and a self to become. If you were born to paint, it is your job to be a painter. It is your job to be what you were born to be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I hope you are where you have always wanted to be, but if not, then ask yourself, why not?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we&#8217;re old and near the end, we’ll go home and start again.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Thank you so much for reading this blog and sharing your time with me.  You have enriched my life just because you have allowed me to do what I love.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/fec85574b70a0a619cfa2afd0e389aec/10e3a/lottery.jpg","width":225,"height":225}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"7986ae4e-c94a-57cd-bca6-9a94ce6df9a0"}}
