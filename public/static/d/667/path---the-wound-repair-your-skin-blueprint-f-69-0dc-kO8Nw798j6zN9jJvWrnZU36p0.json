And, of course, protecting all that new baby skin too.  I show you how to do that too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No Botox, no fillers, no facelift can do what the  &#8220;Wound &amp; Repair Your Skin Blueprint&#8221; can do for your skin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to add Botox and other procedures to enhance the your outcome, then go right ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However,  you just might want to start with the Blueprint and then go from there ðŸ¤—</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Youâ€™ll see significant changes at 30, 60, 90 days! You&#8217;ll see and it just keeps getting better and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider this Blueprint a beginning to get your skin in the best shape and then secondly, consider it a maintenance plan for life because the more you stick to the plan the younger your skin will look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click the link to get on the list: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://myagingandwellness.lpages.co/the-wound-repair-course\">https://myagingandwellness.lpages.co/the-wound-repair-course</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Xoxo-copy-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8842\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Xoxo-copy-2.png 500w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Xoxo-copy-2-150x150.png 150w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Xoxo-copy-2-300x300.png 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Xoxo-copy-2-290x290.png 290w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Xoxo-copy-2-345x345.png 345w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Xoxo-copy-2-100x100.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://myagingandwellness.lpages.co/the-wound-repair-course\">https://myagingandwellness.lpages.co/the-wound-repair-course</a></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/fec629c619786f9345d301ca166cfb93/c0005/Xoxo-copy-2.png","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"28bf629e-1ce4-5282-88cb-93b89e65d33e"}}
