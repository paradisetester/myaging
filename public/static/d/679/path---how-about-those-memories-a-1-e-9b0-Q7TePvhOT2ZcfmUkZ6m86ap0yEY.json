Smith, M.D. in his book &#8220;Renewal,&#8221; he suggests to his patients that they take &#8220;24 percent standardized extract.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Standardized means that basically, it was verified in an approved lab and measured for it&#8217;s effectiveness.</p>\n<p>As per Dr. Timothy J. Smith, he suggests to stay clear of all non-standardized products because one never knows if they are getting a therapeutic dose or not.</p>\n<p>To recap here, taking a standardized Ginkgo everyday has proven to help with the nervous system, circulatory system and sensory system.</p>\n<p>Referenced from: &#8220;Renewal&#8221; By Timothy J.
