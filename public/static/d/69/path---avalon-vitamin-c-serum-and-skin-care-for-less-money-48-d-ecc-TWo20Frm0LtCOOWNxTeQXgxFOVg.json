Welcome back!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p> Today I want to talk to you about vitamin C Serum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was using the same vitamin C for about five years and then they stopped making it. I don&#8217;t know what happened, but I loved it, they stopped making it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then when I went out to look for new vitamin C, I had the choice of some really expensive ones, like $166, to $250. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I go through that stuff every four weeks or so, I can&#8217;t afford that along with all my other products. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just can&#8217;t add another product that cost $200. It&#8217;s just not feasible, it&#8217;s not practical for me, and that&#8217;s it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>I usually don&#8217;t use cleansers and toners, because I usually use Dove soap. I&#8217;ve been using it for 30 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> I love it and it works for me. But I love vitamin C, I love how it brightens up my skin, it gets rid of my age spots, and it just makes my skin tone even. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I was set out to find my vitamin C, I found this brand. It&#8217;s called the Avalon Organics, and I got this at Whole Foods. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could get it at whole Foods, you could get it at my link, or you could just go on Amazon and get it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>This is amazing. It&#8217;s a facial serum that&#8217;s concentrated and it has no GMOs, no parabens, no sulfates, no preservatives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s really important. Most of all, what I&#8217;ve learned about vitamin C is if you get air in it, it becomes oxidized and it doesn&#8217;t last that long and its potency doesn&#8217;t last. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with these pumps, you pump the vitamin C in your hand, it doesn&#8217;t get air back draft into it, if that&#8217;s the right word for it, and it stays fresh.  We don&#8217;t want it to turn orange and get oxidized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Let me show you what oxidation means. When I used to use other Vitamin Cs, I would get them in a dropper and every time I would take the dropper out it would fill up with air. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then after a couple of weeks, my product was oxidized and the potency wasn&#8217;t good. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See in my video that nasty orange look? Actually, it&#8217;s turning almost a dark brown and the smell is not good. I don&#8217;t want to use this. I don&#8217;t want a product that&#8217;s going to get air in it, because its potency&#8217;s going to be lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> That&#8217;s super important, it&#8217;s just as important as having enough of the active ingredient in your product.  The two main factors when we&#8217;re using anti-aging products is the active ingredient and the decline of air and oxidation.. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, when I found this that has the pump, it doesn&#8217;t get air in it, I loved it. It goes on really, really smooth, like water. It&#8217;s not sticky at all.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s like $24. It&#8217;s amazingly priced. You can use this every day on your face, neck, and chest, and you can feel good about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on top of that, I found that they also have an intense vitamin gel cleanser and then a vitamin C toner. So add these to the serum and, wow, your skin really does change. These are only, get this, like $13, $14. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>When you buy things like SkinCeuticals and Obagi, the cleansers are like $60, $70. Their serums are like $100 to $200. All three of these things cost, let&#8217;s see, maybe $30, $40 dollars!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are going to last me for about six weeks. That&#8217;s a deal, because the vitamin C that I was using, I was paying like $45 to $50 just for the vitamin C by itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I just wanted to show you the vitamin C that I found, and that is the Avalon Organics. The great thing is all this is organic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>No chemicals, no nothing, and it actually works really good. Then the intense vitamin C gel cleanser works amazing, and this toner works amazing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use it after the third or fourth time, you can actually see your skin brighten right in front of your eyes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>I Just wanted to share that with you so you wouldn&#8217;t have to spend a bunch of money on vitamin C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> If you&#8217;re looking for organic with no chemicals, this is also a <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">very</g> great option for you. Thanks for watching and I&#8217;ll see you next time. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-24-at-4.14.49-PM.png\" alt=\"Organic Vitamin C Serum and Skin Care\" class=\"wp-image-8801\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-24-at-4.14.49-PM.png 992w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-24-at-4.14.49-PM-300x221.png 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-24-at-4.14.49-PM-768x565.png 768w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-24-at-4.14.49-PM-624x459.png 624w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-24-at-4.14.49-PM-600x442.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Cz9zQy\">Organic Vitamin C Serum and Skin Care</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the link to the product in this video: https://amzn.to/2Cz9zQy<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Cz9zQy\">https://amzn.to/2Cz9zQy</a></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/c77c67f6dc64d1986ad3c6e5ce6b21ba/c0005/Organic-Vitamin-C-Serum-for-a-whole-lot-less-money.png","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"227736f3-a5e1-5a75-a8d7-fc2fa3075ab8"}}
