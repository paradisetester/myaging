Face primers specifically for us women that have mature skin. Yes, I said mature skin, but you know what, we can make our skin look amazing. We can start by using primers, and you don&#8217;t have to spend a lot of money.</p>\n<p>I have tried products anywhere from $5 to $50. But I&#8217;m here to show you what works the best and for very little, so stay tuned and we&#8217;ll do that right now.</p>\n<p>Okay, so I didn&#8217;t start using primers until I was 52 years. I&#8217;m in my mid-50s, and I wish I had started using them earlier because it helps with large pores, which I have, it helps with texture, which I have.</p>\n<p>I have a lot of rough texture and primers really set the tone for your foundation and they make your skin look flawless.</p>\n<p>If you use the right primer, it won&#8217;t settle into lines and wrinkles, because that can make us look worse and make us look older.</p>\n<p>So the primers I&#8217;m gonna start with, my very first primer was Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, and I love this primer, I swear by it, I love it so much. But it&#8217;s pricey, I think I paid like $40 and it doesn&#8217;t last really long.</p>\n<p>Using it every day, it probably lasted me about 30 days. I like products that work really well and don&#8217;t cost a lot of money. So Fenty Beauty, if you have a lot of money to spend, good for you, but I don&#8217;t because I like using a lot of products.</p>\n<p>But if you want to try this, I suggest that you do because it&#8217;s really smooth, it lasts all day, and it&#8217;s just amazing. So the Fenty Beauty by Rihanna is my number two for the price.</p>\n<p>And then, of course, you have all these little primers that we won&#8217;t go over. Like I have 10 here, so we have Malani, which you can&#8217;t get at Walgreens. And I didn&#8217;t like it too much, because it made my face look kinda oily. And then the NYX Hydration, well, that&#8217;s supposed to be for mature skin, but it makes my skin look a little oily as well.</p>\n<p>And then we have another one, this is LA Color, you can get it at Walgreens, and this is like five bucks, and it was okay. I didn&#8217;t really like it as much as I like Fenty Beauty, but still, I didn&#8217;t wanna pay the price, right? So I&#8217;m on a mission to find a better primer.</p>\n<p>Then I went and tried the Elf Poreless. And this is pretty good, it&#8217;s like $3 and I got it at Target. So this is pretty good if you just want to use it to go to the grocery store, it&#8217;s three bucks, it&#8217;s pretty good.</p>\n<p>And then, of course, I tried some other ones by Avon, and some pore fillers by NYX. And I just tried a whole bunch. I tried about 10.</p>\n<p>So then I went into Sephora and the people that are working there, of course, they always have flawless skin and they do their makeup really well, and I asked them, &#8220;Well, how do you get your skin to look like porcelain?&#8221; And they said they use this Benefit primer, it&#8217;s called Pore Primer. It fills the pores and makes your skin look really good, and I tried it, I really really liked it.</p>\n<p>Then after a while, I started feeling like I&#8217;m looking older, my face was looking caky and stuff. So I think this Pore Primer by Benefit, you can get it at Sephora or Ulta, it&#8217;s probably more for younger skin than our older skin. So that is that.</p>\n<p>And then I started the Kat Von D. And this one was pretty good, but it felt a little sticky, a little heavy, and it was pretty pricey too. So these two I got at Sephora, and they&#8217;re around the same price, like $40-$50, and that&#8217;s a lot to spend when you have a ton of other products that you use.</p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Best Primer for Mature Skin</span></h1>\n<p>So what did I find? Tada! My number one primer for our age is Covergirl Trublend. It&#8217;s a skin primer and pore reducer. But guess what, this is a purple. They come in different correction colors, and I accidentally got a purple, I didn&#8217;t know there was a correction color line. So I got this and I love this stuff, and it&#8217;s like $10, and I&#8217;ve been using it for a month now, and I still have half of a tube here.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m going to go ahead and say this Covergirl Trublend is the best primer that I have found for our age, and you can choose.</p>\n<p>You can do your yellow color for red correction. It says the purple is for reducing pores and outbursts of maybe spots and creates a perfect canvas for a long-lasting weightless feel, and truly it does work.</p>\n<p>And I will not switch back to any of these primers. I actually have these and I&#8217;m only gonna use this $10. I can buy five of these for what I pay for one of these.</p>\n<p>But a little secret here, with your primers, if you buy them, you could also use these for your legs or your arms or whatever you want and kind of put some body makeup.</p>\n<p>So don&#8217;t throw away your old primers, and you don&#8217;t necessarily have to buy a $10 or a $40 primer for your body. You can just go buy the $3 elf primer at Target or Walgreens and you can use that on your arms, and then you put a little bit of foundation on there, a little bit of powder. It gives you a really nice clean smooth look if you have spots.</p>\n<p>So with that being said, thanks for watching this video, and I will see you next time!</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/6867a7e0a981ff5c3b0196ab19877dcc/c0005/Untitled-design-4-copy.png","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c47fbca7-7c3f-5d36-8b83-065e2abead14"}}
