This will not only reduce waste but hydrate you as well.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you hate water, combine lemon and a little plant sweetener called Stevia.  Drink decaf, green tea too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be sure not to drink all of your water at once because this can be dangerous.  Drink it during a 24 hour period.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><strong><u>Avoid processed foods</u></strong></span></h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><strong><u>and eat clean</u></strong></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Try not to eat any processed foods. That means don’t eat any food from your pantry, except certain proteins (see below).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eat fresh food like vegetables, low glycemic fruits and, nuts.  Try and eat as natural as possible without overcooking.  Like raw, smoothies, salads, or, steamed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eliminate the following:  caffeine (or cut in half), sugar, flour and, alcohol.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eat whole foods.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><u> Seek out and consume antioxidants</u></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eat bright colored veggies.  They are full of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals and, your liver loves these because phytochemicals help activate liver enzymes that remove harmful substances from our bodies.</p>\n<p>They also help with inflammation ( a significant factor in disease) and nourish your gut.</p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Limit meat consumption but get protein from other sources like tofu, nuts, beans, Quinoa, seeds, lentils, Tempeh, pea and rice protein, nut milk, chickpeas, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Besides meat having a ton of growth hormones and antibiotics that you don’t need, meat can contribute to, disease and stay undigested in our systems for longer than we need.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You don’t need to stop eating meat if you don’t want to, however, for this 3-day detox and rejuvenation plan, try to let your body rest from having to work too hard.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><u>Try and eat organic</u></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s unfortunate that to eat healthily we have to pay more for organic but, it’s the way it is and your body has to choose between cleaning off the pesticides or nourishing your body.  When you eat organic, you give your detox system a break, so that it can work on giving your body the nutrients that it needs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you can’t afford organic, then wash the heck out of fruits and veggies when you consume the skin.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><u>Eat fermented foods</u></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kimchi, miso, sauerkraut, tempeh all offer payoffs because they help your gut fend off bad bacteria and provide good fiber.  Fiber is what we are also going for.  We need to mop up all the bad cholesterol and eliminate waste.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I get mine in the produce aisle where they have the vegetarian cold foods.  You can always get these at Whole Foods too.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><strong><u>The last step in our 3-day detox </u></strong></span></h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><strong><u>and rejuvenation plan is to get it all out! </u></strong></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Being regular is your most important pathway.  Even if you go every day, chances are you could go a little more.</em></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Extra and undigested food is processed through the intestines, and we don’t seem to get rid of nearly half as much as we take in!</p>\n<p>Try Smooth Move tea, one tea bag each day of the detox.  The tea is mild and not harsh on your system.</p>\n<p>If you do these easy steps in just three days, you will feel great and, you may even lose a few pounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>As you can see, the “<u>3-day detox and rejuvenation plan”</u> is not hard to do.  Three days will fly by.  YOU CAN DO IT!</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Maybe, you’ll want to continue to eat like this forever?  If not, then try and do this three-day detox and rejuvenation every six weeks.</p>\n<p><em>DISCLAIMER:  The tea is an herbal tea.  Check with your doctor to make sure any medications you are taking will not have negative side effects.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/e39128306c0bce9b3dd5006b45aa0f5e/1a478/35404982_s-400x280.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"6edb78b1-f596-57ad-9744-123d1935b2f4"}}
