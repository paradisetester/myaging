{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"What we think is truly who we are..","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the last several months, I&#8217;ve been going through some personal issues.  While I won&#8217;t burden others with what they are, I will say that the way I feel physically and mentally has been like being on a roller coaster!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One day I&#8217;m hopeful and the next, I&#8217;m planning a future that I&#8217;m terrified of. Only to bounce back and forth for what seems like a time in my life that will be a long road of uncertainty.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;ve come to realize that, what ever the long term decision I make, I won&#8217;t make it too quick and if that means to others that I&#8217;m sitting on the fence, then I&#8217;ll sit on the fence for just a bit longer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have always believed that while going through rough times, we can either wallow in the pain and ask why me (and believe me I know that grieving any type of loss is normal and should happen) there are moments that creep into my mind that ask another question and that is &#8220;now what are you going to do about it?&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Which brings me to the whole point of this blog post.  Why do I let my mind tell me how or direct how, I feel each day?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When times are good I feel great and the sadness and worry no longer enter my mind but, when things take a turn for the worse, all of the fear and the &#8220;what if&#8221; takes over my mind and my spirit, leaving me metaphorically dragging until the next wave of hope comes along.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then, I am happy again and the world is mine.  What happens when that next happy wave doesn&#8217;t come?  Will I slither into a dark hole that I can&#8217;t get out of?  If so then why?  Why would I let myself do that when nothing externally has changed?  People change around me but I don&#8217;t and I&#8217;m realizing that this is the root cause of my pain.  I don&#8217;t have to or wan&#8217;t to be anything but who I am.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I am happy nothing outside me has changed just my thoughts.  When I&#8217;m down nothing outside me has changed either, just my thoughts again.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have come to realize that circumstances shouldn&#8217;t dictate how I feel and how I see the world.  Controlling ones mind is not that difficult if we stop the intruding thoughts that we ourselves create.  We create bad thoughts, we create good thoughts, it&#8217;s just the same. It&#8217;s what we attach to those thoughts that is the issue.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I remember this past week driving in my Jeep (which I love to do) with the windows down, the radio blasting and feeling the cool breeze at the moment and then the next moment breaking down crying while singing along with the song on the radio.  Only then, to smile again with happiness that things aren&#8217;t so bad ( by now you&#8217;re probably thinking I need professional help but keep reading).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At that moment I made a commitment to myself and that was to keep that pleasant thought in my mind of being in the moment and knowing that I myself control how I feel and how I will feel from then on no matter what circumstances bring me.  I have the power, I always have and I always will..</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The statement &#8220;change your thoughts, change your life&#8221; couldn&#8217;t be more true 🙂</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/2f9a819096b212a286f8a6697f2dafef/990e0/mepicture-278x280.jpg","width":278,"height":278}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2634dde5-3c10-5353-9790-c52c7c23d02d"}}
