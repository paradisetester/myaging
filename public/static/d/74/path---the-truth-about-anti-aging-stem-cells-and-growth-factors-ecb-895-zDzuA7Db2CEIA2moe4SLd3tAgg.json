Â They say the older you get, the faster you get older. Â I know you don&#8217;t want to hear that. Â I sure don&#8217;t! But it&#8217;s true.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s easier to fight the effects of aging on our face than our body because we have different cells that turn over much better above the neck. I&#8217;m not going to go into all the layers and cells of the skin because frankly, I&#8217;m not a Dermatologist and the point here is to find ways NOW, that work, to anti-age and re-engineer our skin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, I&#8217;m not talking about not aging because let&#8217;s face it; we&#8217;re not going to get out of here alive! Â With that said, I say, why can&#8217;t we age fantastically too?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am so fascinated with aging and on how we can reverse, fend off, or just stop using numbers to signify the stage of life that we&#8217;re at.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is also the reality of being a woman of a certain age (say 50, or so) that you kind of disappearÂ in society. Â People look past us sometimes and honestly, that can cause one a bit of insecurity. Â Well at least for me sometimes.</p>\n<p>The great thing is that at 50 we start to look inside ourselves and not so much on the outside (too bad society but, regardless of what you see, we see a beautiful person that feels good inside). Hopefully, Â you see yourself this way?</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;\"><strong>Anti-aging stem cells and growth factors in skin care</strong></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stem cells and growth factors. Â These are what I use on my face, neck and chest to prevent and reverse wrinkles.</p>\n<p>Real quick, I&#8217;ll give you my ten minute daily regimen and then move on.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><em>Mornings: Â Vitamin C 25% serum, TNS (growth factors), under eye cream, a good moisturizer, sunscreen, makeup.</em></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><em>Night: Â TNS, Retin-A, under eye cream, moisturizer.</em></span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This has been working wonderfully for the last, I&#8217;d say fifteen years.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A lot of people don&#8217;t know what stem cells are used for in skin care or know what growth factors are so, I&#8217;m here to give you what I have learned so that one, you buy products that actually work and two, you don&#8217;t get scammed by the words &#8220;Stem Cells&#8221; and &#8220;Growth Factors&#8221; and then pay way more than you have to.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;\"><strong>Stem Cells</strong></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not all stem cells are equal. Â You&#8217;ve probably heard of stem cells in the medical field or a science fiction movie or somewhere. Â Maybe you even feel that you&#8217;re against them because, you don&#8217;t actually know how they are harvested? A stem cell can actually turn into an organ depending on the signals that it&#8217;s given. Pretty amazing I think!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just like inflammation in the body causes diseases like heart disease and cancer, most aging skin is also caused by inflammation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, something internal or environmental happens, we get free radicals and then, inflammation sets in and boom! You&#8217;ve got a new wrinkle, sagging skin or whatever. Â You wake up, look in the mirror and swear that your face changed over night!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cytokines are growth factors made from stem cells. Â By using these in our skincare, we can create an anti-inflammatory response.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We couldn&#8217;t just take our own or someone else&#8217;s stem cells and then throw them into our moisturizer because, they are not stable enough by themselves. Â Believe me, I would have already done this if it was possible ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em><strong>Let&#8217;s move on here..</strong></em></span></p>\n<p>So when companies say they are using stem cells in their products, they mean that &#8220;they are usually using ingredients derived from stem cells&#8221; (Zoe Diana Draelos, M.D.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Diana Draelos, M.D. professor of dermatology, says that stem cells need to be purified and grown in Petri dishes. Â They need to be fed a high protein diet with, amino acids and, glucose. (Hmm.. maybe this is the type of skin diet I can research for us all?)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em><strong>Here&#8217;s how stem cells get their beauty:</strong></em></span></p>\n<p>When stem cells are in the Petri dish, they have contact with other stem cells and then start to communicate thus, creating growth factors. These growth factors create signals to cause other cells to change or grow, etc.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The main sources of stem cells are plants, animals and humans. Â Long story short (without going into all the scientific part), we don&#8217;t need to hurt humans or do anything immoral or unethical to get them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Labs can grow stem cells by bio-engineering them from our own cells, (or from another person), umbilical cords, bone marrow, placentas, and, fat tissue. Â Stem cells from fat can be directly used without any modifications. Now how do I get my fat cells out of my body and into my moisturizer?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The problem with buying beauty products that say they have growth factors from stem cells is, efficacy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When buying skincare products with stem cells, ask the company how they get them. Price doesn&#8217;t determine quality either.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, we won&#8217;t grow younger using stem cells but by using them, we have some of the most potent tools to allow our skin to have a new life and with that, less wrinkles and firmer skin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">sourced from: new you magazine 2016</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate.
