Â Now, I find that I Â rarely connect with myself anymore.</p>\n<p>So, I started a list (on my smartphone of course) on the ways that I have started connecting with myself again.</p>\n<p>The following is my list:</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">10 Ways to Reconnect With Yourself</span> ðŸ˜˜</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Do one of the following or more!!</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8308\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8308\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8308\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/13861807_s-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"Connecting with yourself\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/13861807_s-300x199.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/13861807_s.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8308\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Connecting with yourself</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take fifteen minutes per day no matter what to reconnect.</li>\n<li>Sit next to a window and just stare and daydream.</li>\n<li>Take a walk. Â When is the last time that you took a walk by yourself?</li>\n<li>Get on the floor and stretch every part of your body.</li>\n<li>Meditate. Â It was hard for me to meditate because I am an anxious person by nature, however, using my smartphone, I downloaded an app. with meditation music. Â Â I close my eyes and try to stay in the moment. Â I go through a list of forgiveness and gratitude and before I know it, fifteen minutes is up, and I feel great! Â It takes a few times, but the music helps.</li>\n<li>Sit in a sauna or Jacuzzi and just relax. Â I use an infrared sauna, and I sit in it for thirty minutes per day. Â I swear it clears my mind.</li>\n<li>Okay, I&#8217;m about to go deep here ðŸ˜¬Â  Comfortably lay down or sit and think back as far as you can remember to when you were a child. Â Then, watch yourself grow up. Â Go through every year of your life until now. Â If you can do it, it&#8217;s amazing. Â If you&#8217;re like me and you have some forgiving yourself to do, it is very healing and closes a lot of doors.</li>\n<li>If you&#8217;re lucky enough to have a parent or both, spend time with them weekly. Â It&#8217;s one of the biggest connections with yourself that you&#8217;ll miss when they&#8217;re gone.</li>\n<li>Do something that you love. Â I love to cook and I really get into the groove. It relaxes me. Â Maybe you like to crochet or paint? Â Fifteen minutes a day will create some beautiful things in no time. Â Remember though, no agenda.</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t wait until the kids are grown, the debt is paid off, you retire, or anything else. Â Do what you want now because today is a gift and tomorrow is not promised. Â I&#8217;m sure that I don&#8217;t have to remind you about how life goes so fast.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice that I didn&#8217;t say exercise on the list. Â I think that doing anything that has a goal defeats the purpose of connecting with yourself as there is an agenda.</p>\n<p>The ten recommendations above are so that your mind and your soul can merge together without a whole lot of effort.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like resting the mind so our soul feels regenerated.</p>\n<p>That was my list. Â I would love to see yours. ðŸ˜€</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate.
