No.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Which brings me to the point of this post.  While reading emails this morning an article about Julia Roberts popped up and it was about her stating that women should just be themselves and she said “Perfection is a disease of a nation.&#8221;  I agree.  I&#8217;m not trying to be perfect.  No one can be.  Believe me, I not deluded in thinking that I&#8217;m not getting old and that soon, my wrinkles will be beyond repair.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is a little more of what Julia Roberts said about women and aging:</p>\n<p class=\"canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm canvas-atom\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" data-type=\"text\" data-reactid=\".14gau488gzk.0.2.4.0.0.$Col1-0-ContentCanvas.2.4.0:$3\">“We overlay our faces with tons of make-up. We get botoxs [sic] and even starve ourselves to become that perfect size. We try to fix something but you can’t fix what you can’t see. It’s the soul that needs the surgery.”</p>\n<p class=\"canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm canvas-atom\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" data-type=\"text\" data-reactid=\".14gau488gzk.0.2.4.0.0.$Col1-0-ContentCanvas.2.4.0:$4\">Roberts, who recently attended an event with her kids, also issued a call to action saying it’s time to take a stand. “How can you expect someone else to love you if you don’t love yourself? You have to be happy with yourself. It doesn’t matter what you look like on the outside, it’s whats on the inside that counts.” (https://www.yahoo.com/style/julia-roberts-fights-beauty-standards-with-a-128644174578.html</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here I am reading this and agreeing with what she says and I really think she is right however, we live in a world where when you hit about 50 as a woman to men, you disappear.  I like myself and it should be each persons prerogative to do what they want but only if they do it for themselves.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure you could be married, in a relationship but, you still want to look good and feel good about yourself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If that means that some of us want to fight aging a little and get some procedures here and there, well, to each her own..</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you don&#8217;t that&#8217;s okay too 🙂</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"9388cc37-7030-5046-adde-ba17a90cd4e1"}}
