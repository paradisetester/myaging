Look for AAAASF, AAAHC or JCAHO operating facility certification.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Ask about the anesthetist’s qualifications. For safety, you want either a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) or a Board Certified Anesthesiologist administering your anesthesia. <a href=\"http://www.americanboardcosmeticsurgery.org/patient-resources/choosing-a-cosmetic-surgeon/\">(http://www.americanboardcosmeticsurgery.org/patient-resources/choosing-a-cosmetic-surgeon</a></li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">I always check to see how friendly and how happy the staff are.  If they are not happy then, to me, it raises questions in my mind.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">Never get cosmetic surgery based on the price.  Procedures are different but the knife is a whole other story.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The key to getting good results after you have researched your doctor is to be in good health, expect realistic results and, to maintain the results afterwards.</p>\n<p>These are only some of the ways to find a good cosmetic surgeon.  Please do your due diligence when it comes to finding a good plastic surgeon.</p>\n<div id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1491411699682_5166\" class=\"body undoreset\" tabindex=\"0\"></div>\n<div class=\"body undoreset\" tabindex=\"0\"></div>\n<div class=\"body undoreset\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Just a quick note.  I am putting my affiliate links to products that I swear by below.  Vitamin C &amp; E Serum is fantastic for smoothing out and evening out your skin and, TNS Recovery Complex is amazing in that it has the most growth factors that help me with skin texture and wrinkles!</span></strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><b><i> Vitamin C + E Serum  </i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>(</i></b><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2nLH9fh\"><b><i>http://amzn.to/2nLH9fh</i></b></a><b><i>)  </i></b></li>\n<li><b><i> </i></b><b><i>TNS Recovery Complex   </i></b><b><i>(</i></b><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2oKKTLR\"><b><i>http://amzn.to/2oKKTLR</i></b></a><b><i>) </i></b></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">If you seriously want smoother skin then check out my &#8220;Smooth Skin&#8221; course where I will show you exactly how I get it.  No needles, fillers or surgeons needed here!</span></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">https://how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com</span></a></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"20169d55-6b65-5039-9bec-30da9ed42330"}}
