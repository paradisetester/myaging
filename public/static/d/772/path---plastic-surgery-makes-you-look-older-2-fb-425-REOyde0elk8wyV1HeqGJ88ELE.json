I need to do whole bunch of stuff to my face because, you won&#8217;t look younger, you will look done!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;m not saying that if you want plastic surgery or cosmetic procedures that you shouldn&#8217;t.  Let&#8217;s face it, unfortunately, we live in a world where it seems that women over fifty disappear.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We live under the pressure to not only look good but, look younger for our age.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am a woman who uses Botox<strong><sup>™</sup></strong>, works out, injects filler now and again, and uses the best skin care creams that my budget allows.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, there comes a time when you begin to see changes in your body, face, and skin that no creams, fillers or injections will ever change.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The thing is, now that I am turning 50 in two months, I have a little more money to do some cosmetic procedures but the question is, should I?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do we all get to the fork in the road at a certain age and then, we go the surgery route or the natural aging route?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For some, it may be just a matter of aging gracefully and for those, I so admire you and wish that I could just be content and go with the flow.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The thing that gets to me the most is, when I walk into a room, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m not even there.  I know I&#8217;m there but no one else does.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With that said, it&#8217;s starting to be okay because I&#8217;m finally accepting that I am, and I will, continue to age. We all will.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I used to think that it would be nice to stay the exact age that I am now and never get old but then, I got a little sad because those that I love would get old and they would die and, I would be left here without them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don&#8217;t wan&#8217;t to start a new life with new people all the time just to stay young.  Hell that already feels exhausting!  I wan&#8217;t to go and age along with the people I love.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I guess this post was supposed to be about plastic surgery and how, if you get it, not to go drastic because, it will just defeat the purpose and make you look older.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was the point of this blog but as usual, I got off track in pondering life and ultimately death.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aging is scary because I guess, I&#8217;m afraid of dying so when I think about it, I don&#8217;t need to worry so much about how I look while I&#8217;m still here but, how I will live, love and laugh with the time that I have left.</p>\n<p>Check out my free &#8220;2 Cheat Sheet Fast Weight Loss Formula&#8221;  It&#8217;s the fastest and easiest way to lose weight in either two or four weeks!  Down load it right here:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ztxw2xk\">http://tinyurl.com/ztxw2xk</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7336\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2-693x1024-203x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"157\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2-693x1024-203x300.jpg 203w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2-693x1024.jpg 693w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2-693x1024-624x922.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 157px) 100vw, 157px\" /></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/ffc374b63b94498258f073bcc631e0c4/1a478/meandbrandi2-400x280.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"e4017575-91b7-5ff0-9799-31309e6705cb"}}
