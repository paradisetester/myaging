It&#8217;s sold in CVS, Walgreens, probably your local grocery store. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years I was using a product called TNS, it&#8217;s made by SkinMedica. It has growth factors in it and it&#8217;s awesome. It works amazing, but it&#8217;s $200. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, it&#8217;s probably more than that. It started out like $95, now I see it on Amazon for almost $300. I cannot afford $300 a month for just one product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that being said, I always seek out to find products that actually work, not just say that they will or say that they&#8217;ll change the appearance of your skin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want products that actually change my skin and where I see a difference, and I see a difference within 30 days, if not sooner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was looking for growth factors, peptides, and things like that because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really going to change your skin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found this product, it&#8217;s called No7 Serum and it&#8217;s called the Protect and Perfect Advanced Serum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why this serum is so good is because it has, a proprietary ingredient, and peptide, but they also have the Matrixyl 3000 Plus peptide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a combination of the most powerful Matrixyl Plus of the next generation of peptides to change the skin. I just found this Matrixyl 3000 last year and I love it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found it in this product, which is called Baebody Eye Gel. They&#8217;ve got it in there too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has really tightened my eyes. I mean, my eyes were crepey and this really, really tightened my eyes. You could get this product â€¦ I don&#8217;t know if you can see it, but I&#8217;ll put it on the link here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this product, you can get it for $25, if not even cheaper, on Amazon. The reason why I also like this product is that it&#8217;s in a container that you just squeeze. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s in an awesome dispenser so that air doesn&#8217;t get into it, as it gets oxidized and then you lose its potency, it keeps the air out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You just pump this and a little bit comes out and you use it on your eyes. I&#8217;ve even used it on my neck, it&#8217;s tightened my neck. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The product in here, or the peptide in here that&#8217;s making this work is called the Matrixyl 3000. It&#8217;s a patented peptide and it really does work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The great thing about both of these products is you don&#8217;t have to spend hundreds of dollars. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This right here is $39 at Walgreens. I happen to be one of their point members or their members, I signed up with my phone number. So I got this for $39 and then I got another one for 50% off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is going to last me for about three months maybe, two to three months. That&#8217;s it, and that cost is like a quarter of what I would have paid for one product if I was still using the TNS product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then you add this for your eyes, and this is $27. So both these products, this one you buy $39 and $25, you&#8217;ve saved so much money just by going to Walgreens and just by going on Amazon. I&#8217;ll put both of these links below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again, the key ingredient, the active ingredient that makes both of these products work is the Matrixyl 3000 peptide. It&#8217;s amazing, try it for yourself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use it for 30 days. This product, I&#8217;m not going to go back to TNS or all those other big brands, because this actually works really, really good. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can afford to buy two of these and use them on your face, your neck, your chest, and even the top of your hands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> If you really want a good synergistic effect, try this Baebody Eye Gel with the same peptide for $20, $25. Both of these together in combination work amazing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just want to share that with you so that you would have things like this to help with you through antiaging and get better <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">skin,</g> and look as good as you feel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for watching, and I&#8217;ll see you next time ðŸŒº</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/60182a20b5f85ca1f1c3ab272a5fcfb1/c0005/No.7-Serum-Matrixyl-3000-Peptide-Review.png","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"b074b468-770a-5840-b095-67846ef901ec"}}
