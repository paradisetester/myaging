I love Zicam and here&#8217;s why!</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Last Sunday, I got a call from my brother at one in the morning telling me that my mother had passed away.  Needless to say, I was very sad and super stressed out, realizing that my world had just flipped upside down.  On the day that you lose your mom is the day that the world will never be the same.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although this post isn&#8217;t about my mother&#8217;s passing, it does have something to do with the topic of Zicam Cold Remedy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two days after my mother&#8217;s passing, I woke up with a sore throat and a heavy feeling in my chest.  I have to say that knock on wood, I haven&#8217;t had a cold in probably ten years.  I take some great supplements and try to keep myself healthy and disease free.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With that said, when I woke up that morning, I knew that I had a cold coming on and that it was probably brought on my the stress of losing my mother.  I believe so much that when our body&#8217;s are under stress, our body&#8217;s have to manifest themselves in some way.  My cold was my body&#8217;s way of dealing with my emotional toll.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My mother passed five days before Christmas this year (2015) so, not only did I have to organize her funeral, I also had to continue to keep living life and deal with the holidays so that, my family would know that I was going to be okay.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The thing was that, the more I tried to continue on, the more I felt my cold coming on.  I had congestion and I felt weak and, I knew that if I didn&#8217;t get better quick, this was one of those colds that would last for weeks and, I just didn&#8217;t have time for it right now!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is when I remembered that I had read something about Zicam Cold Remedy.  I remembered the article said, &#8220;Zicam reduces the duration of a cold&#8221; so I figured, if I got some, I really didn&#8217;t have anything to lose if it didn&#8217;t actually work.  I was getting a cold anyways.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I got the Zicam nasal swabs.  The first day I used them just like the directions said and a little more than the directions said.  I broke up the swab, swirled it around the inside of my nostrils and repeated this several times per hour for that entire day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The next day, I woke up and I swear, I didn&#8217;t have one symptom.  The day before, I walked around with a box of Puff&#8217;s, nose running, sore throat,  chest hurting and, I really felt awful.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I couldn&#8217;t believe it.  I thought it was a fluke.  I thought for sure that my symptoms would return but they didn&#8217;t.  And the next day, on Christmas Eve, I felt even better.  On Christmas Day, I had not one symptom of having a cold.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, some may not think that I actually didn&#8217;t have a cold and that, maybe it was some kind of allergy.  But, I don&#8217;t think so because , I have allergies to cedar and the cedar for this week has been extremely low and, I take allergy medicine when this happens.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I had a full blown Winter cold coming on and I used Zicam Cold Remedy and it worked! It&#8217;s pretty sweet when a product makes a claim and it actually does what it says!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I love Zicam Cold Remedy because not only did it stop my cold dead in it&#8217;s tracks, it also gave me the time I needed to grieve for my mother and be with my family for the holidays.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">*This is not a sponsored post.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Before you go, I created &#8220;The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.&#8221; In just seven</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><em>https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</em></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":null},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"d6948ae8-5fd9-57bc-9714-84a75edb2e4d"}}
