Yep, exposure is how we get over fear, not by hiding from it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We resist life because we have an underlying fear of not. Overcoming fear is a deliberate intention of taking action to take the necessary steps to do so.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to overcome fear, you must give up the struggle to remain afraid. We try too hard to protect ourselves and, thus, we don’t grow and we remain troubled.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have you heard the phrase “You create what you fear”? It’s true. What you put out there comes back to you. If you fear you will always be broke, you will always be broke. If you fear you will always be alone, you will display this to others and you may even push others away.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other side of this is to never make a decision based on fear because the opposite of what you intend will happen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some people build their whole life avoiding fear. They set their lives up so they don’t encounter anything that is troubling. We are not talking about the boogieman or a fear of spiders here, we are talking about the internal fear and the pain we hide inside.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It could be rejection or insecurity, whatever the pain is. We have to ask ourselves why we have fear and pain. By avoiding pain we end up bringing pain into every part of our life. Events affect our heart and simple things cause us pain, insecurity and an unfulfilled life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s time to get some perspective and not let meaningless things control our lives. For me, I had the pain of social anxiety. It was very painful for me to go out in large social events. I didn’t realize this and I carried this pain for a long time. And what’s worse is that I manipulated the world around me to avoid the pain.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wanted to be comfortable without anxiety, but I felt others were judging me when I was only judging myself. To be free, I began to realize that I was afraid of rejection. Wow! How ridiculous is that? First of all, people weren’t concerned about me at all. I only imagined they were.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most people only care about themselves and they are not focusing on anything more than that. But what part of rejection was I really afraid of? Was I not good enough, pretty enough, smart enough? No one is perfect, right?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eventually, I got over this by changing my thinking. I realized I didn’t feel good enough. This comes from childhood and issues about being moved from place to place and never being able to connect to long-term relationships.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is the kicker: we don’t have to be afraid. We can teach ourselves to unlearn most emotional pain and habits that keep us there. Nothing, or no one, came into my life and caused my anxiety; it was just my way of thinking that caused my pain. Nothing outside of me caused it and nothing outside of me could fix it. I was both the cause and the answer to my problem.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If for any reason you are living with some type of fear that is preventing you from living a full life, you can overcome it. Get some help, read self-help books, join groups, talk to someone. Make it your mission to remove this barrier while you still have time to create the life you deserve.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/61492d6a8de0fa6b05c98665d40a59ac/1a478/29575892_s-400x280.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"0a978d7a-c4cb-5b61-bb1a-84a5a8b3d02e"}}
