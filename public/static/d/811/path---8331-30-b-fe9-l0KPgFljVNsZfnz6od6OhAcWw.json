Or, like last night, I stood at the bar trying to get a glass of wine, and they looked right passed me.</p>\n<h3>Maybe my real fear is getting old?</h3>\n<p>Later that day, I met my daughter for dinner, and I explained the radio conversation, and she just rolled her eyes and said, &#8220;Mom that&#8217;s not how it is.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although I would like to believe her, I also had to set her straight and explain that this is, in fact, is the way that it is.  Men can date half their age and women can barely get a date after fifty or sixty let alone beyond.</p>\n<p>Which brings me to a time when my husband and I were eating dinner, and I pointed to a few beautiful women, and I said:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>&#8220;If we ever got a divorce, one of those women would be your next wife.&#8221;  He quickly replied with &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to date women our age if we got a divorce.&#8221; </strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"> I was mortified because for one, I needed him to at least lie to me and say <em><strong>&#8220;Yeah&#8221;</strong></em> and two, I didn&#8217;t need confirmation on what I already feared.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine said she was playfully joking with her husband and she said:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>&#8220;Okay if you get a girlfriend then I&#8217;ll go find a guy too.&#8221; </strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong> He replied &#8220;Oh yeah?  Well, I have more value than you at your age.  The joke went from funny to not so funny, super quick!</strong></em></p>\n<p>I was listening to Kathleen Turners interview yesterday with Vulture Magazine, and she said that she once got a script and when she read it, it said, that she was going to be thirty-seven years old and &#8220;<strong>STILL SOMEWHAT ATTRACTIVE!&#8221;  </strong></p>\n<p>Geeze, if we are only somewhat attractive at thirty-seven because that&#8217;s when we&#8217;re old, how are women over fifty supposed to feel?  I am not implying that we have to be what others think as beautiful but, we have to feel good in our skin.</p>\n<p>I know too that it&#8217;s not about how we look, it&#8217;s about the connections in life that we make.  It&#8217;s not about things it&#8217;s about living the beautiful life that we are given.  I know that life is short and if God forbid I am diagnosed with a terminal illness, none of this crap that I&#8217;m writing about even matters!</p>\n<p>So I am not going to insert the word <em><strong>but </strong></em>here because writing the above paragraph just put it all in perspective, whereas when I run it through my mind, it wasn&#8217;t so clear.</p>\n<p>Life is not about fearing and worrying that someone that is supposed to love you and be faithful to you is going to trade you in for a newer model.  It&#8217;s about trusting and loving that person with all that you have.  We can&#8217;t fully love if we are in fear of loss.</p>\n<p>The truth is, we are all going to be alone one day.  Whether it&#8217;s through death, divorce, or whatever.  Life has a beginning, a middle and an end.</p>\n<p>No matter what, it&#8217;s important to live all three of these parts because while I was worried about stupid shit like getting old and younger women, the sun is starting to set in the third part of my life and there&#8217;s no time to waste 🙂</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8169 aligncenter\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2459-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2459-300x200.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2459-768x512.jpg 768w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2459-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2459-624x416.jpg 624w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2459-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Marriage, Divorce, Single after 50!</span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em> </em></span></h2>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c84c0677-6d71-5851-bed8-c6c61f7f8005"}}
