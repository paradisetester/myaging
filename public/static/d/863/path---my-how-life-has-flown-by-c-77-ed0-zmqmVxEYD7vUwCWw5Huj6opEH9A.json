Youâ€™re getting close to sixty.</p>\n<p>I never thought I would be sixty and with God willing, I will make it there.Â  I know there are many who have never had the chance.</p>\n<p>I am so grateful to be alive and thankful. Â  Each day my appreciation and my gratitude for life expand, and I am humbled in a way IÂ  that I never thought possible.</p>\n<p>I feel that I am in a good place in my life.Â  Where I used to have regret for the things that I have done and the mistakes that I have made, I feel now that there is no time for regret only time for forgiveness and moving forward.</p>\n<p>One thing that I am learning is to live with is the loss of my mother and my brother.Â  They died on the same day exactly two years apart.Â  I miss them both.Â  It took me over a year to accept that they nor I will live forever.Â  Iâ€™m grateful that my mother often visits me in my dreams.</p>\n<p>Thatâ€™s one of the great things about being younger (besides being skinny and not having to work out), you never think that you or anyone you love is going to die.Â  I guess it crosses your mind, but you never get it until someone dies.</p>\n<p>I hope that my mother and my brother are in a beautiful place.Â  They were both in terrible spiritual pain that they tried to alleviate the pain through means of physical relief that ended their lives.Â  It is my prayer that they are together and out of misery.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">My how life has flown by</span></h2>\n<p>I guess the point of this post was going to be about how fast life has flown by and all of the ways that it has, however, now, my heart is guiding me in a new direction of not focusing on what was but instead on what is.</p>\n<p>Sure my adult kids will never be my babies anymore.Â  I will retire, the calendar will move faster and faster and, my time will be over too.Â  Just like everyone else.</p>\n<p>The thing is, life is about living.Â  Live is half chance for me and everyone else.Â  If youâ€™re lucky, you got most of it right but, if youâ€™re human you a lot of it wrong.Â  Iâ€™m at the time where I can now make it right.</p>\n<p>At this point in life, I want to give more than I receive.Â  Put back more than I take.Â  I want to step back and let others shine.Â  I no longer need the spotlight and wish I knew then what I know now because I would have never needed it then.</p>\n<p>I have the life that I want because my mother taught me what not to do.Â  I created the complete opposite and have everything that she did not.Â  I have good kids, a loving spouse, materials and mostly, piece of mind and serenity. Â  These are the things that eluded my mother for her entire life.</p>\n<p>So my point (yet again, I know) is that the meaning in life is whether you will make it the best life that you can so that you can lift others up so that, they can do the same.Â  I believe this changes the world and this is our legacy.</p>\n<p>So to take it down the line, my daughter got her masters in School Psychology.Â  She specializes in helping autistic, and special needs children get noticed so that they wonâ€™t become a statistic.</p>\n<p>I guess God wanted my mom to be here so that she could have me, so I could break the cycle so that, I could have my daughter so that, she can change the world.</p>\n<p>My work is done ðŸ™‚ Iâ€™m ready to get old now.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate.
