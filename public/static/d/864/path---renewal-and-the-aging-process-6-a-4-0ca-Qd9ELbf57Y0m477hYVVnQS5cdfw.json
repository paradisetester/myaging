we feel more tired and, absolutely have to take care of our bodies just to feel good each day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just because we turn 50, it doesn’t mean its all downhill for us.   Sure, when we were young we had a free ride and now, the free ride is over.  We shouldn’t panic.  Maybe we watched our parent’s age and it wasn’t so great.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then, we expected we would age like them and felt we had no control in the aging process.  We see wrinkles and gray hair and, begin to believe we are destined to age and, there is nothing we can do about it.  We think “it’s just a matter of time” before our number is up.  But, it doesn’t have to be this way.  With a little modification, we can live a long and healthy life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we put effort into renewing our bodies, the old philosophies are shattered and, so are the popular myths about aging.  We are older and wiser now and, we have the key to good health through the renewal process.  Whether you received a key is up to you to decide if you want to open the door to great health and vitality.  It requires a bit of effort, discipline and a few lifestyle changes but its not anything we can’t have if we want it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The rewards can be tremendous.  If you consider the alternative to renewal, it’s only a matter of time before disease will set in and your number will be up in one way or another.  We may still live long but the quality will be far different than had we taken the necessary steps to renew our bodies.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we don’t eat right or we don’t exercise and, we endure emotional stress, it causes our bodies to wear out before their time.  For some, years or decades before they should have to.  We have all seen that 40 year old who looks 60 and vice versa.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Believe me, it’s more than just genetics.  By undermining the renewal process you deny yourself the support your body requires to renew its systems.  If we do our job and take care of our body, our body will do its job and take care of us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our body will remain strong for a very long time and we will benefit at any age.  It’s important not to accept a decline in our body’s ability to be healthy.  Contrary to what we are told, it’s not a natural decline.  It’s only natural if we abuse our body and not replenish it properly and, the sooner you begin, the better life you will have.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You are never too old to start taking care of yourself.  Even if you are very old, don’t tell yourself “why bother now.” Now is as good a time as any.  So you may be in your seventies, eighties or even nineties and think there is not enough time to make a difference.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me tell you that you can add good quality years to your life.  While you are living and breathing you  can still enjoy what life and the world has to offer.  Yes we will all die but why not live well and be healthy and happy while you are still here.  Why rush it?  Why not make just a few changes or makes some modifications slowly to have a better quality of life?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>If you would like to get my PDF on how to get started here is the link below:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=imgedit-preview&amp;_ajax_nonce=c3b68c6a16&amp;postid=98&amp;rand=78613\" width=\"106\" height=\"106\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/the-5-huge-mistakes\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/the-5-huge-mistakes-/</a></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;
