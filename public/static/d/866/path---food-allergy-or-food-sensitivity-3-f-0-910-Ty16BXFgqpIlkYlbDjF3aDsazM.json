{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Food Allergy or Food Sensitivity?","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Food Allergy or Food Sensitivity?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;The lab results are back and you are allergic to everything you&#8217;re eating!&#8221; This is what my doctor told me at a follow up visit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course I was confused.  How could I be allergic to everything that I ate?  Wouldn&#8217;t I be dead?  She handed me a report sort of like the book reports that we used to turn in, in high school.  You know the ones that have title, introduction, body and a conclusion.  All nicely three hold punched between a clear front and back cover.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I could see the title through the clear cover and it said.  &#8220;Food Allergy report for Theresa Skrobanek.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was about ten pages long.  My doctor said that my allergies were more like a food sensitivity because I was eating the exact same things each day and/or, I had some other allergies so, I needed to eliminate all the foods in the report and then slowly work them back into my diet to see which ones I was allergic to and, which ones I had a food sensitivity to.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was beside myself because that seemed like way too much effort and being a person who loves to eat, I was freaked out.  More so because, I&#8217;m already a Vegetarian and I was limited as it was to what I ate and now, I had to eliminate the rest of what I ate!!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Turns out that the problem was the frequency of what I ate.  On a typical day for about fifteen plus years, I would wake up, get a handful of almonds and shower.  Then, I would head out the door to work and at lunch I would head to Whole Foods and get tofu and salad.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For dinner, I would eat carbs, etc. and some kind of protein.  But I did this everyday of the week and soon it became a problem.  I didn&#8217;t know it but my body was no longer absorbing any nutrients from the food  I was eating. It was now sensitive to what I ate.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We&#8217;ve all heard that too much of a good thing is not a good thing and who would have thought that those tasty little almonds would become my enemy all when I thought they were keeping me so healthy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some people do get sick from food allergies, etc. but, I just gained weight and lost nutrients.  My bones became brittle, I was anemic, my doctor added one supplement after another marking it up as just getting older until she decided to check me for food allergies.  It was as though I wasn&#8217;t eating at all but just getting the calories stored on my body.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are a lot of food allergies like gluten, dairy, yeast, sugar, wheat, corn, food additives, fermented products and even (dare I say it!) wine.  I love wine..  I won&#8217;t make this a longer blog post than it needs to be because if you suspect you have a problem, it&#8217;s wise to get a blood test.  It&#8217;s quick and simple.  Just don&#8217;t get carried away and walk around like I did and act like your allergic to everything a now you can&#8217;t eat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I eliminated the foods on the report and then worked them back into my diet.  Turns out that the change I needed was to not eat the same thing everyday and diversify my diet by, at least rotating food groups, like we all should do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I do stay away from gluten and I have found out if you have an auto immune problem, like thyroid disorders (like I do), gluten can be like allergy and may attack the thyroid.  I don&#8217;t want to take more medicine so it&#8217;s very easy to avoid gluten.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Who knows, maybe I created the auto immune problem in the first place by eating the same exact thing everyday?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the end, I am no longer anemic, my bones are stronger, I have lost ten pounds and I try to never eat the same foods two days in a row.  I haven&#8217;t gone back to get retested.  I guess for now, I will listen to my body..</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/0e084243ff360a3b8ded1778ace055c8/1a478/44170745_s-400x280.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"0069854e-2461-5869-bf06-d548d6ca3fe0"}}
