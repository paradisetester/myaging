 What the hell!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What I was feeling was that I had lost my youth and I was now an old lady.  How did I get here and now what?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, let me say that I&#8217;ve been incredibly fortunate to get to be old because many never get the opportunity to get old but damn, did it have to come so fast and damn, I better not fall apart!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After leaving my doctor&#8217;s office, I called everyone that I knew and told them the news &#8220;I&#8217;m in menopause (like it was some awful diagnosis and my time was ticking away) and it didn&#8217;t seem to phase anyone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I got stories back like, &#8220;Oh yeah?  I&#8217;ve been for several years now.  Or, welcome to the next part of your life.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I drove home and contemplated what my next step would be (like I had no choices left in life or something).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One month after the blood test report, I went back to my doctor and told her that I was ready to fight!  I wanted to stimulate my ovaries and keep my body as young as possible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This was when the real trouble began because trying to regulate your hormones is challenging.   I asked for Bio-identical hormones, and then one led to the next and the next, and they just kept coming.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I had long cycles, missed cycles, sleep issues, mood changes and other problems that weren&#8217;t the nicest, to say the least.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was 48 years old then.  Now I am going to be 51 next month, and I think I have a handle on menopause and I am accepting of getting old.  In fact, I have a whole new outlook on the next chapter of my life.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Don&#8217;t fear menopause and here&#8217;s why</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7525\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meandbrandi-2-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meandbrandi-2-400x280-300x210.jpg 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meandbrandi-2-400x280.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Back in the day when our mothers went through menopause, they either had to suffer through the symptoms or take synthetic hormones that caused more harm than good.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I remember how miserable my mom was.  Not only the physical symptoms were bad, but back in the day, they didn&#8217;t have the resources and opportunities that we have today.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that I have almost completed my menopause and have my bio-identical hormones stable, I can concentrate on things like living life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Life is almost better now.  I miss my kids, and I wish that they didn&#8217;t have to grow up so fast but, they have moved out and my husband and I have the house to ourselves.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s amazing.  I don&#8217;t have to clean up, chase after anyone, spend my money or do anything other than what I want to do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I can often travel, which I do.  I can buy whatever I want for me.  I can do the things that I&#8217;ve put off while raising a family and, life seems much more meaningful at the same time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, there are tradeoffs like losing my appearance, declining muscle tone, losing memory and, knowing that my health may decline.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, I always knew that the day would come where I would look into the mirror and see my aging self.  Not that I don&#8217;t fight it!  I can because I have money now and if I wanted to get some work done, I would.  For now, I will wait.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">About losing my once perfectly toned body, well, I work out to keep what I can, and that&#8217;s all I can do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I will not let my health decline because I don&#8217;t have to.  With technology and a clean diet, I can avoid many of the diseases that come along with aging.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are emotional issues that accompany menopause as I have seen it first hand with women I know and these are depression, anxiety, and a few others.  Not to diminish any of these, however, if you have these issues now, please do something for yourself and seek help.  There are so many treatments that will help you.  There is absolutely no reason to suffer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also believe that many of the emotional issues that come with menopause are because we haven&#8217;t yet accepted that our roles have changed and that we are not needed like we once were by others.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sometimes we don&#8217;t let go of the past and then we get stuck in a sort of mourning place.  Although it may not be easy to move on, we have to.  We had to move on from being a baby, a child, a teen and now it&#8217;s time to move into probably the best part of our lives.  We cannot stop what must be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The biggest thing that I see that causes emotional and spiritual pain at middle age is when we have nothing going for ourselves.  No hobby, no interests, or anything.  This is the time that we need to find our joy, our voice, our peace for our next chapter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now is the time of our lives.  No more menstrual cycles to deal with anymore.  No more raising kids.  No more having to put everyone else ahead of our needs.  IT&#8217;S OUR TIME!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don&#8217;t fear menopause because I believe this will be the absolute best time of your life if you accept it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Enjoy because by now you can appreciate how fast time goes by.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Just a quick note.  I am putting my affiliate links to two products that I swear by below.  Vitamin C &amp; E Serum is fantastic for smoothing out and evening out your skin and, TNS Recovery Complex is amazing in that it has the most growth factors that help me with skin texture and wrinkles!</span></strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><b><i> Vitamin C + E Serum  </i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>(</i></b><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2nLH9fh\"><b><i>http://amzn.to/2nLH9fh</i></b></a><b><i>)  </i></b></li>\n<li><b><i> </i></b><b><i>TNS Recovery Complex   </i></b><b><i>(</i></b><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2oKKTLR\"><b><i>http://amzn.to/2oKKTLR</i></b></a><b><i>) </i></b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em>If you would like to find more ways to Rejuvenate.  I have created a six-step course called &#8220;The Rejuvenation Program&#8221; </em></span></h2>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><em> You can check it out by clicking this link: <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.therejuvenationprogram.com/\">http://www.therejuvenationprogram.com</a></span></em></span></h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_8361\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8361\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8361\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png\" alt=\"The Rejuvenation Program\" width=\"300\" height=\"251\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-300x251.png 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-768x644.png 768w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-624x523.png 624w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program-600x503.png 600w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/The-Rejuvenation-Program.png 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8361\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Rejuvenation Program</p></div>\n<p align=\"center\">\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/c38efeae2421f0bc3e9a7171ea8fa969/1a478/19092747_s.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"7b8021f0-c9d4-535a-ad8b-2029a61dac82"}}
