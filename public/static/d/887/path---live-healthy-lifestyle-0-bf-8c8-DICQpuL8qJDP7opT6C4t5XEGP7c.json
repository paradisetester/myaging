Each person requires sleep at different levels.  I have to have about eight to nine to feel my best.  I am envious of people who say that they only need four or five hours of sleep per night.  Wow, I could get a lot more done if I only needed four or five.  Sorry, I&#8217;m digressing but, still, it&#8217;s a fantasy of mine not to need to sleep so much.</p>\n<p>Back to our point.  As we age our sleep needs,loose tend to decline and with that, so does their ability to stay asleep. This is because we have a decrease in brain chemicals such as serotonin and melatonin levels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;\">Find something you love to do</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that I don&#8217;t have to tell you that when you are doing something that you enjoy, this is when you are the most content and happy.</p>\n<p>Being happy by finding a hobby or something that you enjoy regularly doing benefits as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Happiness protects your heart.</li>\n<li>Your immune system.</li>\n<li>Combats stress.</li>\n<li>Improves mood and depression</li>\n<li>Happy people have fewer aches and pains.</li>\n<li>Combats disease.</li>\n<li>Lengthens our lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One quick suggestion.  Don&#8217;t turn the thing that you love to do into a business or job because many become unhappy when the thing that they love becomes a machine that they are no longer in control of.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;\">Eat a good diet and drink clean water</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>It has been established that certain dietary practices can cause or prevent disease.  The following are ways to have a health-promoting diet:</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eat a plant based diet.  Primarily vegetarian.  If you can&#8217;t then limit meat of any kind (that includes fish) to two to three times a week.</li>\n<li>Reduce fat intake.</li>\n<li>Eliminate sugar.</li>\n<li>Reduce exposure to pesticides and herbicides.  Eat organic.</li>\n<li>Eliminate additives like food coloring, etc.</li>\n<li>Eat whole foods and stay clear of packaged foods.</li>\n<li>Lower salt intake.</li>\n<li>Drink 32 to 48 ounces of filtered water per day (or more).</li>\n<li>Identify if you have food allergies and steer clear of them.</li>\n<li>Stay withing a daily calorie intake to maintain ideal body weight.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;\">Supplementing</span></h2>\n<p>I supplement every day with supplements such as vitamin D, vitamin C, fish oil, vitamin B and, about five or six others.  I get my levels checked once a year, so I know where I stand with regards if what I&#8217;m doing is working or just a waste of money.</p>\n<p>I feel better while supplementing because when I miss a day or two, I notice a difference.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Here is what the FDA says about supplements:</span></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">What are dietary supplements?</span></h3>\n<p>&#8220;Dietary supplements include such ingredients as vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and enzymes. Dietary supplements are marketed in forms such as tablets, capsules, soft gels, gel caps, powders, and liquids.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm109760.htm\">source: http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm109760.htm</a></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">What are the benefits of nutritional supplements?</span></h3>\n<p>&#8220;Some supplements can help assure that you get enough of the vital substances the body needs to function; others may help reduce the risk of disease. But supplements should not replace complete meals which are necessary for a healthful diet – so, be sure you eat a variety of foods as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm109760.htm\">http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm109760.htm</a></p>\n<p>Unlike drugs, <strong><em>supplements are not intended to treat, diagnose, prevent, or cure diseases</em></strong>. That means supplements should not make claims, such as “reduces pain” or “treats heart disease.” Claims like these can only legitimately be done for drugs, not dietary supplements.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7288\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7288\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-7288\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20959515_s-400x280-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"How to take supplements\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-7288\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How to take supplements</p></div>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Are there any risks in taking supplements?</span></h3>\n<p>&#8220;Yes. Many supplements contain active ingredients that have strong biological effects in the body. This could make them unsafe in some situations and hurt or complicate your health. For example, the following actions could lead to harmful – even life-threatening – consequences.&#8221;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Combining supplements</li>\n<li>Using supplements with medicines (whether prescription or over-the-counter)</li>\n<li>Substituting supplements for prescription medicines</li>\n<li>Taking too much of some supplements, such as vitamin A, vitamin D, or iron<br />\nSome supplements can also have unwanted effects <em>before, during, and after</em> surgery.
