Before if you got your nose done, it was the smaller the better.  </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Now, if you get your nose done it’s not done too small and sometimes you may need to get your chin done to give the face more balance.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Or, if you get your breasts done, you may get some liposuction around the breast areas, etc. to give a more balanced look rather than a doctor just inserting big round implants.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>If you get your brows lifted, you might want to get your eyes done to give an overall softer look.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>If you get a facelift, you may add a neck lift as a lifted face accentuates a sagging neck.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Fillers are to add volume to our face as we age and to accentuate our lips and cheeks but not too much at one time.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Too much at one time can make you look over-injected and like you have a ton of products in your face. We have probably all seen this or have been guilty of it.  Believe me, more is not better and it will only make you look older!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>If your face is sagging no filler will lift it up.  You will need a facelift.</strong></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong>The 2019 cosmetic surgery trend is looking like you got nothing done at all</strong></span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Don’t do too much at once it&#8217;s best to do your injections by splitting them up so you will have multiple visits so, you don&#8217;t look like you&#8217;re overfilled and then get re-evaluated.  </strong><strong> Add to it as needed so you don&#8217;t look artificial, plastic or ridiculous.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Believe me, people will notice that you filled your face up with a bunch of stuff and you don&#8217;t look right and, it will be uncharacteristic of your looks. A big sign that you&#8217;ve had work done!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The biggest thing that you can do to look younger after taking care of your skin and working on the texture is adding volume to your face but, do it in increments as our face ages the volume disappears and as it disappears you add a little volume at a time.</strong></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\"><strong>Subtle enhancements are the key and any good doctor will tell you that</strong></span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Just a quick note.  I am putting my affiliate links to products that I swear by below.  Vitamin C &amp; E Serum is fantastic for smoothing out and evening out your skin and, TNS Recovery Complex is amazing in that it has the most growth factors that help me with skin texture and wrinkles!</span></strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><b><i> Vitamin C + E Serum  </i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>(</i></b><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2nLH9fh\"><b><i>http://amzn.to/2nLH9fh</i></b></a><b><i>)  </i></b></li>\n<li><b><i> </i></b><b><i>TNS Recovery Complex   </i></b><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FD2OAe\"><b><i>(https://amzn.to/2FD2OAe</i></b><b><i>) </i></b></a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><em><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">By the way.  If you want smooth skin at home without a cosmetic surgeon, I have created a quick course on just how to do it!  </span></em></h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Here&#8217;s the link:<a href=\"https://how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com\"> https://how-to-get-smoother-skin.teachable.com</a></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8634\" style=\"width: 352px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8634\" class=\" wp-image-8634\" src=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/How-to-get-old-and-be-happy-copy-300x251.png\" alt=\"How  to get smooth skin without plastic surgery\" width=\"342\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/How-to-get-old-and-be-happy-copy-300x251.png 300w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/How-to-get-old-and-be-happy-copy-768x644.png 768w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/How-to-get-old-and-be-happy-copy-624x523.png 624w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/How-to-get-old-and-be-happy-copy-600x503.png 600w, https://myagingandwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/How-to-get-old-and-be-happy-copy.png 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8634\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How to get smooth skin without plastic surgery</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/9f9abc2c0885691ccabf4a8a9be86351/1a478/22178742_s-400x280.jpg","width":300,"height":300}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"de7567c8-f04b-5227-a3ee-ba9c69184a67"}}
