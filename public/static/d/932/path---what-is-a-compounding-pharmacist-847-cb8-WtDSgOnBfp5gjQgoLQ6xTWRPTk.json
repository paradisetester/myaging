Pharmaceutical compounding is performed or supervised by a pharmacist licensed by a state board of pharmacy Compounded drugs are not for resale by the patient or prescriber.&#8221; (http://www.pharmacist.com/frequently-asked-questions-about-pharmaceutical-compounding)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is one thing that I would like to mention here and that is that many or all of the drugs that compounding pharmacists make have virtually the same side effects as the manufactured ones.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I made the mistake of walking around thinking I was never at risk for breasts cancer because I wasn&#8217;t taking a synthetic estrogen replacement hormone but, a compounded, bio-identical one.  I thought that this freed me from any risks associated with regards to an increase in breast cancer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was wrong! My doctor told me they are virtually the same risk.  So the take away here is that, yes, having a compound pharmacist create a prescription specifically for you is great however, it doesn&#8217;t free you from the risks associated with benefits.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"d1386efd-f802-5b90-a448-791a5581a75d"}}
