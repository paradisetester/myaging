Changes occur all around us and there is nothing we can do about it. Sometimes change is good and sometimes, as we feel change, it may be uncomfortable, so we resist it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even after all the resisting we do, there comes a time when we are ready for a change. When we accept it, we listen to our inner self, possibly the one that has been talking to us our whole lives, but only now are we listening.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It‚Äôs the voice that we have always wanted to hear, but didn‚Äôt take its advice until now. It‚Äôs time for a change and with change comes healing and transformation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Transformation is growth and with growth comes the ability to release the past, the pain, and accept what the future will bring. Many of us make New Year‚Äôs resolutions and most of us break them.<span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">I know I do within the first week, so I stopped making them. Do we really need the start of a new year to change something we don‚Äôt like?¬†</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The key to making a change is wanting to do it. Even if we fail on our journey, the more we keep trying, the greater the chance is that we will succeed. I don‚Äôt need a diet to deprive myself. As soon as I say diet, I get a negative emotion that pulls me in the opposite direction and I automatically go right back to the way I was or sometimes worse.<span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">I get the opposite reaction. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">Instead of feeling pleasure I feel pain, and this is what I focus on. I realize that I don‚Äôt need to constantly live like this. The fact is, I don‚Äôt need to diet; I just need to eat better. We as a society put so many restrictions on ourselves and when we don‚Äôt succeed we punish ourselves and the cycle continues. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">I need to make a lifestyle change, that‚Äôs all. If you want to make a change, make a change, but don‚Äôt do it because of others. You know what will and will not make you a better person. This is the only change we really need to make.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no one solution for change. Everyone is different and it is through trial and error that we succeed. I tend to go in circles when I don‚Äôt know how to make a change. This wastes so much time that I often stop trying and start again later, only to go in circles again.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once I fall, I know why I fell and I don‚Äôt fall that way again. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I fall and sometimes many times, but eventually, I learn what doesn‚Äôt work even if only by default and I succeed in the end. It‚Äôs the only way I know how. No sense in kicking ourselves when we are down. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to be defeated before we start. I have wasted a lot of time in my life, not by trying and falling and trying again, nope, I have wasted more time not doing anything at all.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are sitting on the fence or the couch for that matter and you know it‚Äôs time for a change, what are you waiting for?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Momentum kicks in in any situation when we get started. Think about when you were in school and you had a term paper due. You may have been the kid who waited until the last minute because you didn‚Äôt have a topic and you didn‚Äôt know where to begin. Painfully, you waited until the last minute and got started the night before or the morning that it was due.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It‚Äôs not so much that time isn‚Äôt on your side, its momentum that kicks in and you get on a roll. Once you are at this phase, you are blowing and going and you see the end in sight. It‚Äôs just like change. You realize that it‚Äôs not so hard and wonder why you didn‚Äôt do it sooner. We make things harder than they need to be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are also elements of change. We need to understand there are several factors involved in changing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">Readiness, barriers and relapse should all be expected on the road to change. We only make change when we are ready to. I want my mom to stop smoking and take care of herself, but she is not ready to and at seventy-one, she probably never will be.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\"> I can‚Äôt do anything about it, only accept it, and she has to own it and pay the consequences. I spent a lot of years trying to get her and others to change for the better and I always met with resistance. It wasn‚Äôt until I came to terms with the truth that no one will ever change unless they want to, not because I wanted them to. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">Why I needed someone to be other than who they wanted to be, I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs obvious when health is an issue, you want your loved ones to be around; however, if this is not what they want, it‚Äôs no longer a problem for me. When I stopped preaching to my mother, our relationship got much better. She is happy with who she is, and if this is what she chooses for her time left on this earth then it is what it is. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6em;\">Just like anything else, change comes if and only when we are ready and only then will it happen. When my mother passes one day, I will stand over her grave and think back to when I wanted her to change and then I will come back to the memory of her saying that she was happy with her life.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Barriers to change are other obstacles to overcome when we want to change. What is preventing us from changing? I will go back to my mother‚Äôs story (last time I promise). Why wouldn‚Äôt she want to stop smoking and get healthy so she can live longer and have a better quality of health? I would surmise that she doesn‚Äôt want to make the change because, in her mind, it would be more painful to live without cigarettes than it is to live with them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They give her pleasure even if they are ruining her lungs. They are her companion when she is alone. Maybe she looks at the long term and feels the pain instead of making a specific goal of taking quitting one day at a time. It would be much easier to quit if she would think like this. Change is made when it is self-motivated and by positive thinking.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It‚Äôs important to know that change happens gradually. There will be relapse and there may be discomfort. Very few of us are so strong-willed that we won‚Äôt ever have a relapse. Like an alcoholic, not drinking is a lifelong change and one that must always be mindful of.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There will always be factors begging for our attention. Change means being proactive and, if you are, eventually, change will be a commitment you have with yourself.¬† Also know that you may resist what you must do but, you must do what you resist.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wish you the best üôÇ</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created ‚ÄúThe 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.‚Äù In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self! ¬†Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c2f6d676-958a-5f7f-92e9-130f2428778e"}}
