Just think if someone were depressed and they had all the money to throw at the problem and, it didn&#8217;t work.  Where would the hope be?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don&#8217;t have depression (thank God) but I know depression because, I watched many of my dear family members struggle from it and then lose the battle with it.  Depression is not pretty, it&#8217;s delusional and it&#8217;s something that if you haven&#8217;t lived with it, you can never fully respect it&#8217;s devastation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To ask someone &#8220;why are you depressed&#8221; or say to them &#8220;try and be happy&#8221; or, &#8220;get over it&#8221; is like saying to a dying cancer patient, &#8220;just get your out of bed and will yourself better.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Depression doesn&#8217;t care about the person that it occupies.  It puts that person in a deep dark hole that most can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t climb out of.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, there may be medication and talk therapy but, I don&#8217;t see a lot of people recovering completely.  I think once it grabs on to your soul, you try and try as you may, you can&#8217;t ever fully rid yourself of it&#8217;s disgusting grip.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know people can live with depression just like diabetes, aids, and other diseases however, these are diseases of the body that allow one to move about the day but having a disease of the mind and one of the spirit, stays with you twenty-four seven.  It never lets go and, never allows one to live with intention.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two weeks ago, my mother finally found peace by overdosing on Methadone.  I was in awe when I saw her sweet little body on her couch.  I could see that she was no longer in spiritual pain and she was set free from the darkness that lived in her soul.  I was happy for her and I knew this day would come.  I was very sad but something in me found a comfort that I can&#8217;t explain.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genetically, the odds are against me.  Genetically they are against my children and, honestly the cycle has continued to where I can&#8217;t say now however, when someone asks why a depressed person just can&#8217;t be happy, I respond back with &#8220;yeah and why can&#8217;t a brain tumor just magically disappear with only a smile.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 9.6pt 0in 9.6pt 0in;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">Before you go, I created “The 7 Steps to Rejuvenate and Renewal.” In just seven</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">steps you can feel amazing without depriving your self!  Click the link below:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\">THE REJUVENATION AND RENEWAL PLAN</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong><i><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #111111;\"><a href=\"https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/\"><span style=\"color: #ba1111; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;\">https://theresaskrobanek.leadpages.co/rejuvenate-renew/</span></a></span></i></strong></p>\n","featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"resolutions":{"src":"/static/4a1effa8723133cefd2d26fc30b7d153/a820e/mentalillness-e1451995715330.jpg","width":200,"height":200}}}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A sample site using gatsby-source-wordpress","subtitle":"Data fetched from a site hosted on wordpress.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"88d88e92-1969-5fd9-8988-826725e99fc9"}}
